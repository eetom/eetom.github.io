          The Ledger Internal admin platform is the backend to the operations at Ledger. It is design for us from Sales, Support, Enginnering, Product, and Data teams to
          work behind the scenes in maintaining our daily business. The Internal admin would be a portal for employees to log in and access and manage customer and product
          data while keeping track of sales and customer progress.

        <h3 id="part-1" class="work-title mt5">01. Version 0.5</h3>
            <p class="work-content">
              Originally, the team had worked with a few different options to do the management and updating of program data. They had tried out 
              things like keeping some records in <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> and backend tools like <a href="https://retool.com/">Retool</a>.
              When those options were't working we replaced those with a rudimentary admin panel pretty similar to the one built in Retool.
            </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/admin-1.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              Here is the home page of the Admin panel v0.5. As you can see most of the page is actually just links back to Retool. We started to 
              add some more functionality such as the program status on the left so that our team can keep track of the program funnel.
            </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/admin-2.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              To help save time and get started the engineers implemented the data tables using the <a href="ledgersignature.html">Signature UI design system</a>. 
              However navigation and responsiveness were not factored in along with other design details.
            </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/admin-3.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              Most of the detail pages looked like giant spreadsheets and retool tables that were straightforward but took time to find what you were looking for.
            </p>


        <h3 id="part-2" class="work-title">02. Research & testing</h3>
            <p class="work-content">
              To build a more full functioning and well designed admin panel. We spent time talking with the users, the Ledger teams who would be using
              it to do their day-to-day work.
            </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/admin-4.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              We interviewed and summed up various metrics and data points that would be useful. Our goal for the new home page
              would be a dashboard that could give the users a quick sense of what the situation was and what needed attention. <br><br>
              Different users might have different numbers and statistics they wanted to see so we also thought about customization and personalization.
            </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/admin-5.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              The PM and I worked to send out a survey to be answered by the users. We analyzed the results and tried to see if there were any
              patterns in the wins and pains for our users.
            </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/admin-6.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              From there, the PM and I came up with basic layouts to review with stakeholders, to play around with the layouts and components.
              It was good to get this level of low fidelity out to get a sense from engineers any potential difficulty and what might need to be a fast follow.
            </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/admin-7.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              I based a lot of my investigative work looking through different designs of data dashboards and what made them work. Some things that really 
              excited me was having some level of customization and personalization such as having your own dashboard set up to how you would best work.
            </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/admin-8.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              It was also important to see the users' path thoughtout the admin platform. I did this by mapping out the various flows a real user might have to click
              and flow through the current admin v0.5 to better understand where our navigation was failing us. 
            </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/admin-9.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              I also started mapping the comments and feedback directly onto the pages to better keep track of what we needed to fix and improve.
            </p>


        <h3 id="part-3" class="work-title">03. Design</h3>
            <p class="work-content">
              After many rounds of revisions and updates, here is the v1.0 of the Admin portal. The main layout has now
              a consistent side bar menu. The menu has the most used "All programs" at the top allowing for easy and frequent access.
              There is room on the side bar for future items such as "My settings" or "BDX consolidation". <br><br>
              In the footer of the app, we added in a section for company frequented links. This would be useful in getting the team to
              start using and visiting key pages such as helping with testing on our staging site or even giving feedback on our designs in Figma.
            </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/admin-10.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              The main page is now fully a data dashboard. We moved all the links to the side and categorized it by user. This would help as an interim step
              for some of the personalization we wanted to put in. There is still an "All" under tools to see all of them. <br><br>
              The data is arranged by top priority when the Ledger team is working on risk origination. The are able to see the where the programs are in the process
              and adjust their tasks to address anything that most needed their attention.
            </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/admin-11.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              The tool pages and detail pages got cleaned up and extra details such as empty states with clear messaging to help with new users who aren't
              familiar with the system.
            </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/admin-12.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              The full details pages have reworked some of the navigation and cleaned up the hirearchy for the program details. The program details section is
              hidden but still accessible when needed. We've opted to keep a majority of the tables as from before and will make changes to those at a later date.
            </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/admin-13.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              There was also a few other UI personalizations we wanted to hold until we added some new features. A lot of the feedback we got after we had launched
              the is first big update on the admin platform has been very positive. The number of our team visiting the admin platform has greatly increased over
              the first first months of launch and we can slowly transition most of the program management features over.
