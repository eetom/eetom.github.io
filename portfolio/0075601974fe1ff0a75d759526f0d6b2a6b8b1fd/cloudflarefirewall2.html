            I designed the first version of self-serve Web Application Firewall (WAF) rule builder.
            This is a feature that allows customers to customize rules for how they want their Cloudflare

          <h3 id="part-1" class="work-title mt5">01. Background</h3>


            <p class="work-content">
              The existing way for customers to access Web Application Firewall rules was to request via support for Cloudflare team to create
              and adjust the rules for them. This was a lengthy process and required a lot of back and forth communication to fine tune rules.
            </p>

            <p class="work-content">
              One of the concerns on how to approach solving this was which customer base to focus on at first. We had 2 levels of customers who 
              were either more beginner and would benefit from a WYSIWYG type interaction or the more experienced engineer who would like to have
              more precise control over how the rules would be created.
            </p>

            <p class="work-content">
              My aim was to explore designs that would allow customers to build rules in a way that they would be most comfortable with.
              That's not to say that advanced users might not benefit from templates or visual builders.
            </p>


          <h3 id="part-2" class="work-title">02. Research + Analysis</h3>
            <p class="work-content2">
              To get a better understanding of the challenges for building for the firewall app I needed to understand how the firewall app worked
              and what kind of jobs and goals did the customer have.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Exploration of the Cloudflare Firewall</li>
              <li>Getting a sense of the customer via sales eng team and support team</li>
              <li>Doing a competitive anaysis on existing rule builders</li>
            </ul>

          
          <h3 id="part-3" class="work-title">03. Prototype + Lofi</h3>
            <p class="work-content2">
              Once I had a better understanding of how firewall worked and what was the range of actions customers would want. I set
              out to explore both visual rule builder and the code builder (Domain Specific Language or DSL).
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Figuring out the logic to construct rules</li>
              <li>Alternating between rule builder and DSL expression editor</li>
              <li>Prototyping rule builder interactions</li>
            </ul>

          <h3 id="part-4" class="work-title">04. Design + Testing</h3>
            <p class="work-content2">
              To ensure the user interface (UI) effectively addressed customer needs, I collaborated with engineers and the
              London-based engineering and sales team. Through paper prototyping sessions, we gained valuable insights into how both teams interpreted
              customer wants and translated them into actionable design decisions. This teamwork led to the development of several key
              UI components:
              </p>
              <ul class="mb5">
                <li>Enhanced feedback mechanisms that provided users with clearer information on existing firewall rules and their
                effectiveness.</li><br>
                <li>A basic rule builder prototype that allowed users to switch between the visual interface and a dedicated Domain Specific
                Language (DSL) view. This addressed the needs of both technical and non-technical users.</li>
              </ul>


          <h3 id="part-5" class="work-title">05. Outcomes</h3>

            <p class="work-content2">
              The redesigned custom firewall experience yielded positive results, providing valuable insights for future iterations.
            </p>
            <p class="work-content">
            <b>High User Engagement:</b> Within the first 6 days of launch, nearly 4,000 users actively participated by creating a new
            custom rule. Over half (over 2,000 users) successfully completed the rule creation process, saving and deploying at
            least one rule. This suggests the core user experience resonated well with a significant portion of the user base.
            </p>
          <img class="work-img" src="work-img/firewall-17.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              <b>Areas for Optimization:</b> The 60% conversion rate for creating custom rules offers an opportunity to further
              improve the user experience. Analyzing user behavior can pinpoint specific areas where users might encounter friction, allowing
              for targeted improvements in subsequent follow up Firewall design.
            </p>
              
          <img class="work-img" src="work-img/firewall-16.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              <b>Advanced User Success:</b> For highly technical users, the new DSL expression editor proved valuable. While a smaller
              group (approximately 350 users) explored this advanced feature, a significant percentage (aproximately 200 users) successfully created 
              and deployed custom rules using the editor.
            </p>

          <img class="work-img" src="work-img/firewall-18.png">
            <p class="work-content2">
              <b>Reduced Support Burden and User Empowerment:</b> The impact of the redesigned custom firewall experience extended beyond
              user adoption. Support ticket data revealed a significant decrease in inquiries related to firewall rules.
            </p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Initial Inquiry Spike:</b> As expected, the launch week saw a temporary increase in support tickets (21 tickets), likely due
                to users familiarizing themselves with the new features. However, this initial rise was quickly followed by a
                substantial decrease.</li><br>
                <li><b>Sustainable Reduction:</b> Just two weeks after launch, support tickets related to firewall rules dropped by 33%
                week-over-week (33 tickets). This downward trend continued, with a further 28% reduction the following week (13
                tickets).</li>
              </ul>

              </p>

          <p class="work-content">
            The redesigned custom firewall experience, proved to be a success. User engagement metrics, reduced support tickets,
            and positive feedback all indicate a significant improvement for our customers. This project serves as a springboard
            for continued innovation. 
            <br><br> 
            By prioritizing an intuitive user experience and empowering users with self-service
            tools, we have empowered them to take control of their firewall security. Looking ahead, the Firewall team had plan to
            leverage the learnings from this project to introduce even more advanced functionalities while ensuring a seamless 
            experience for all user levels.
          </p>

          <p class="work-content">
            This project wouldn't have been possible without the incredible collaboration and support from the London team. Huge
            thanks to Alex, Harley, Mark, Andrew, David, and everyone else who lent their expertise and insights throughout the process. It was a
            true pleasure working alongside such a talented group, and exploring London while collaborating on the firewall project
            made it an even more rewarding experience.
