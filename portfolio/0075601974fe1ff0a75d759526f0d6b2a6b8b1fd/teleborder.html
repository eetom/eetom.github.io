          I joined Teleborder early 2015 as their first designer. The team was eagar to have me onboard to bring focus to the design
          of the company and website. I found it easy to work with the team as many of us had experience with the situation that our
          customers experienced.

        <h3 id="part-1" class="work-title mt5">01. Website</h3>
        <p class="work-content">
          Teleborder's mission was to help both companies and new hires navigate the complexities of working in the US.
          The customers would work directly with our in-house lawyers who would help manage cases and answer any questions along the way.
        </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/tele-1.png">
        <p class="work-content">
          The first touch point that a customer would have for Teleborder is the website. It's here that they learn about
          the company's mission and services to help companies allocate new hires though the complicated work visa system.
          It was important that we would clearly explain the process and build trust.
        </p>

        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/tele-2.png">
        <p class="work-content">
          We designed the website to have many real examples of testimonials and screenshots. The testimonials and social proof
          assured that we were effective and got results. The screenshots showed how the features and services on our platform.
        </p>

        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/tele-3.png">
        <p class="work-content">
          One experiment we did was to launch a landing page where potential workers looking to work in the US could get a summary report
          of the process and difficulty their case could be. This could be use as a starting point to have a discussion with potential
          employers. The website was pushed through the Teleborder social media accounts and quickly became a viral hit.
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="part-2" class="work-title">02. Branding</h3>
        <p class="work-content">
          As a part of the early design work, we worked on a rebranding from the early designs and logos they had while at Y-combinator.
          We wanted to build a extenable brand that could be used both online and offline.
        </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/tele-4.png">
        <p class="work-content">
          I went with this simple color and pattern. We also had many business cards and t-shirts made. One of the best compliments I got was that many
          of the team wore their tshirts outside of work to this day because "it didn't look like a work shirt".
        </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/tele-5.png">
        <p class="work-content">
          I also worked along side the front end engineers to build a early version of a design system with standardize colors and fonts.
        </p>
        
        <h3 id="part-3" class="work-title">03. Platform</h3>
        <p class="work-content">
          Once a customer chooses to work with us. The main interaction would take place on the platform. This is where we had to do the most research and be creative
          with our solutions.
        </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/tele-6.png">
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/tele-7.png">
        <p class="work-content">
          One of the key take-aways we had though our customer interviews was that they didn't want to have more explaination and data neccessarily. They 
          were primarily concenered about status and if they needed to do anything. We worked to keep the amount of forms as light as possible and focused
          on giving the users updates and progress reports when needed.
        </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/tele-8.png">
        <p class="work-content">
          On the other side of the platform where our team would manage the cases, we built in easy access to tools and make custom changes. We spent time
          talking and understand the pains from our team about how many times a case would change and they would want an interface to aid them make those changes.
        </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/tele-10.png">
        <p class="work-content">
          One of my favorite pages we added in for the customer facing platform view was the page when they were done filling things out. We had a relaxing
          beach background image and let them know that we would take care of everything and update them if we needed anything. This was the page
          that we got the most positive feedback about from our customers.
