            I joined Teleborder in early 2015 as their first designer. The team was eager to have me onboard to bring focus to the
            design of the company and website. I found it easy to work with the team, as many of us had experience with the
            situations that our customers experienced.

        <h3 id="part-1" class="work-title mt5">01. Website</h3>
        <p class="work-content">
          Teleborder's mission was to help both companies and new hires navigate the complexities of working in the US. Customers
          would work directly with our in-house lawyers who would help manage cases and answer any questions along the way.
        </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/tele-1.png">
        <p class="work-content">
          The first touchpoint that a customer would have with Teleborder is the website. It's here that they learn about the
          company's mission and services to help companies allocate new hires through the complicated work visa system. It was
          important that we clearly explain the process and build trust.
        </p>

        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/tele-2.png">
        <p class="work-content">
          We designed the website to include many real examples of testimonials and screenshots. The testimonials and social proof
          assured that we were effective and achieved results. The screenshots showed how the features and services on our
          platform worked.
        </p>

        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/tele-3.png">
        <p class="work-content">
          One experiment we conducted was launching a landing page where potential workers looking to work in the US could receive
          a summary report of the process and difficulty of their case. This could be used as a starting point to have a
          discussion with potential employers. The website was promoted through the Teleborder social media accounts and quickly
          became a viral hit.
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="part-2" class="work-title">02. Branding</h3>
        <p class="work-content">
          As part of the early design work, we rebranded from the early designs and logos they had while at Y Combinator. We
          wanted to build an extendable brand that could be used both online and offline.
        </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/tele-4.png">
        <p class="work-content">
          I chose simple colors and patterns. We also had many business cards and t-shirts made. One of the best compliments I
          received was that many of the team wore their t-shirts outside of work to this day because "it didn't look like a work
          shirt."
        </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/tele-5.png">
        <p class="work-content">
          I also worked alongside the front-end engineers to build an early version of a design system with standardized colors
          and fonts.
        </p>
        
        <h3 id="part-3" class="work-title">03. Platform</h3>
        <p class="work-content">
          Once a customer chooses to work with us, the main interaction would take place on the platform. This is where we had to
          do the most research and be creative with our solutions.
        </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/tele-6.png">
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/tele-7.png">
        <p class="work-content">
          One of the key takeaways we had from our customer interviews was that they didn't necessarily want more explanations and
          data. They were primarily concerned about status and if they needed to take any action. We worked to keep the number of
          forms as light as possible and focused on giving users updates and progress reports when needed.
        </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/tele-8.png">
        <p class="work-content">
          On the other side of the platform where our team would manage the cases, we built in easy access to tools and allowed
          for custom changes. We spent time talking and understanding the pains of our team about how often cases would change and
          they would want an interface to aid them in making those changes.
        </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/tele-10.png">
        <p class="work-content">
          One of my favorite pages we added for the customer-facing platform view was the page when they were done filling things
          out. We used a relaxing beach background image and let them know that we would take care of everything and update them
          if we needed anything. This was the page that received the most positive feedback from our customers.
