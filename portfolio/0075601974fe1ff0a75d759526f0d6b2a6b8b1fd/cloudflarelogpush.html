          As a part of the Data product team, one of the projects we worked on was Data Logpush. For many customers of Cloudflare, theres a lot of data that is collected via web traffic 
          passing through Cloudflare's network. Customers can use this data to better understand traffic pattern, audience behaviors, and even better protect their sites from DDoS 
          (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks from malicious sources. <br><br> Logpush allows this data to be push directly from Cloudflare to the customer's own data store. What's
          important here is to create and maintain a link from Cloudflare to the external data store by getting access and maintaining a secure connection.

          <img class="work-img" src="work-img/logpush-1.png">
              <p class="work-content">
                On the data product team, we work closely between product, design, and engineering. Our team has been working on many projects up to this point
                such as the analytics app and data storage.
              </p>
          <img class="work-img" src="work-img/logpush-2.png">
              <p class="work-content">
                One of the early feedback we got was that we had to add in an extra step inbetween to set up a confirmation that the user who was linking
                the data store is an owner of that data store. We wanted to prevent a user from linking a data store that they didn't own but knew/guessed
                the name of.
              </p>
          <img class="work-img" src="work-img/logpush-3.png">
              <p class="work-content">
                A good amount of traffic on the Cloudflare Analytics and Data app page were internal team support engineers that have been dealing with a lot
                of the data requests manually. So much so that internal traffic was the 2nd highest category of traffic just after free users.
                <br><br>
                 If our logpush feature was successful, we would able to allow Pro and Ent users to self-sever data access and reduce load on the support teams while giving
                more autonomy to the customer to get their data.
              </p>
          
          <h3 id="part-2" class="work-title">03. Design</h3>
              <p class="work-content">
                We created this design to be a linear step-by-step process to guide the user through setting up logpush.
              </p>
          <img class="work-img" src="work-img/logpush-4.png">
              <p class="work-content">
                Step 1: The user would select from a list of different data stores that was supported for logpush.
              </p>
          <img class="work-img" src="work-img/logpush-5.png">
              <p class="work-content">
                Step 2a: If the user selected Google Cloud Storage, there would be a set
                of instructions they had to do in the GCS app to allow for 3rd party access.
              </p>
          <img class="work-img" src="work-img/logpush-6.png">
              <p class="work-content">
                Step 2b: Similarily, for AWS there would be some forms that needed to be filled out.
              </p>
          <img class="work-img" src="work-img/logpush-13.png">
              <p class="work-content">
                Step 3: The next step was important. To prove that you were the owner of the data store, we wanted you to add in a file
                that we could read and confirm that you were the owner. <br><br> We create this step to be unique to each of the services that we supported to give specific and
                clear instructions to the customer. With a convenient click-to-copy section, it was easy for the customer to grab the code snippit without downloading an additional file.
              </p>
          <img class="work-img" src="work-img/logpush-7.png">
              <p class="work-content">
                Step 4: In this step, we had a multi-select that allowed the user to choose the conditions on which logpush would send data over. Just turning on full access
                to the data might overwhelm the data store and end up with a lot of noise to signal. <br><br>
                Therefore by allowing specific conditions for when to send the data to a specific folder, the user can better group and organize the relevant data. We turned all the possible options from the possible server into organized
                groups that can be fully selected or partially selected.
              </p>

          <img class="work-img" src="work-img/logpush_demo.gif">
              <p class="work-content">
                Here is a short clip of the logpush set up flow from start to finish.
              </p>
          
          
          <h3 id="part-3" class="work-title">04. Testing</h3>
          <p class="work-content">
            It was important for us to confirm though testing how our design and implementation fared with our internal stakeholders and customers.
          </p>
          <img class="work-img" src="work-img/logpush-8.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              We worked on setting up questions to understand the background of our customers, if they would use Logpush, and how they currently accessed this data.
            </p>
          <img class="work-img" src="work-img/logpush-9.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              We had set up 12 sessions to review the prototype with our sales and support engineers and customers.<br><br>
               <i>*The customer names have been redacted from this schedule.</i>
            </p>
          <img class="work-img" src="work-img/logpush-10.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              During the user testing, we also walked the customer through the prototype. We allowed them to drive where neccessary so that we can see how
              they might react to the design if they were implementing it without observers. This allowed us to see where they might get stuck and which
              parts of the design we can futher refine.
            </p>

          <h3 id="part-4" class="work-title">05. Results</h3>
            <p class="work-content">
              We were able to design, build, test, and launch this product within the set timelines for an April 2019 launch.
            </p>
          <img class="work-img" src="work-img/logpush-11.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              From 2 months from launch, we had established a steady rate of aproximately just under 3000 daily logpush jobs.
            </p>
          <img class="work-img" src="work-img/logpush-12.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              And a lot of positive feedback from our sales and support engineers. Overall, we were able to reduce dependancy on our sales and
              support enginers while allowing customers to have better control and access to their data.
