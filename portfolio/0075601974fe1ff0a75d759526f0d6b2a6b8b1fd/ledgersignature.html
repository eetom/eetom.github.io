          Signature UI design system was the design system that Arjun (Product designer) and I came up with to standardize and
          facilitate the complete overhaul of the Ledger public website, internal platforms, and marketing materials. By spending the time and
          effort to create and maintain this design system we would be able to work faster and more efficiently on update existing designs
          and creating brand new ones as well.

        <p class="work-content">
          In the first year that I joined Ledger, it was in the midst of a platform update as well as a public website
          update. Since we had a lot of work moving forward we wanted to
          have a lot of work done; the design team (Arjun and I) decided that spending a bit of time upfront on the design
          system would be able to save us time rebuilding large parts
          of Ledger.
        </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/signature-1.png">
        <p class="work-content">
          The team had a lot of fun coming up with a name that would match our company origins. Ledger was originally going
          to be based on decenteralized means of insurance.
          In the spirit of this we voted on a design system naming scheme that reflected this.
        </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/signature-2.png">
        <p class="work-content">
          From the starting point we made a big list of all the components and elements that would be where we started.
        </p>
    
    
        <h3 id="part-2" class="work-title">02. Explorations</h3>
        <p class="work-content">
          As part of a semi-rebranding of Ledger. We spent some time thinking about how the look and feel of Ledger might
          evolve from where we started.
        </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/signature-3.png">
        <p class="work-content">
          We thought about the our tone and voice of our visual elements. It would be important as Ledger is a financial
          company that works with a lot of big insurance groups and
          investors. We had to think about our customer base while also the original spirit of the company.
        </p>
    
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/signature-5.png">
        <p class="work-content">
          We got a lot of inspiration from other fintech apps and companies. Looking at the websites and their styles,
          mapping out the current trends and seeing
          what made sense for Ledger.
        </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/signature-6.png">
        <p class="work-content">
          In the end we leaned towards a cooler set of colors with a darker overall feel. We like how this made Ledger feel
          more calm and collected. The colors would still
          have some energy to them using higher contrast tones.
        </p>
    
    
        <h3 id="part-3" class="work-title">03. Design system</h3>
        <p class="work-content">
          Signature UI is technically version 2.0. This is because we felt like 2.0 represented a second vision of Ledger
          from the original design when it was first launched.
          With Signature UI we used this design system to launch a whole new updated website, new customer platform, and
          eventually all the sales and marketing materials.
        </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/signature-7a.png">
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/signature-7.png">
        <p class="work-content">
          The font choice we went with was from Google Font, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter">Inter</a>. We
          wanted something clean and modren that was easy to render
          and always avaiable from Google's servers.
        </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/signature-8.png">
        <p class="work-content">
          To continue to build on the dark tone but high energy contrast of the color scheme, we picked Ledger
          "electric-blue" (#E8EEFF) as our new primary color. The secondary
          accent colors that would fit our cool temperature theme was having Teal (#05FEC1) and Purple (#AE8AFf). These
          three colors would be added on top of dark gray
          and white backgrounds. <br><br>
          We spent a good amount of time tweaking the colors and contrasts to insure that we would have good coverage on
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2</a> color contrast AA
          guidelines.

        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/signature-9.png">
        <p class="work-content">
          Layouts is an important section that we spent some time on. There were two key things we wanted when we were
          working on the design of our grid system.<br><br>
          1. We wanted make sure that we could work with a large number of different web and platform layouts. Some of the
          screens would have different navigational elements
          such as side navs and additional content that would split the number of columns. Other were more straight forward
          but would then end up with a lot of empty space in between.<br><br>
          2. We wanted to make sure that we would be able to design with mobile in mind. Mobile wasn't always just a single
          column version of the page, we allowed for 4 columns to give
          more flexibility if needed.
        </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/signature-10.png">
        <p class="work-content">
          Many more pages and pages of components and details.
        </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/signature-11.png">
        <p class="work-content">
          One of the important things we added to the designs system was sometimes the specific interaction details. We
          would be working closely with the front-end engineering teams
          and for some of the components they would need guidance on how the component would work in different conditions.
          Such as the top nav bar having a different color upon scroll.
        </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/signature-12.png">
        <p class="work-content">
          Something I really enjoyed while working on all this was just being able to experiment and try out differen
          things. We might not have used all of it; in fact
          only the most core components got finalized, but it was still cool to think about and leave new ideas for future
          updates. <br><br>
          For example, I would have liked to continue on the illustration section to build out some components for how
          illustration can and should be used. In that section we gave some examples and would be
          cool to even have parts so that our team could put together custom illustrations. It's things like this that
          really enhances the design of fintech platform from being
          all tables and charts.
