            <p class="work-content">
              Multiple challenges emerged from having scattered data resources across Ledger.
              This project aimed to address these issues by creating a unified, accessible database that would empower communication
              and transparency across all stakeholders.
            </p>

            <div class="blog-callout">
              <ul>
                <h3>Project origination: pain points</h3>
                <li><b>Sales Frustration:</b> The sales team relied on an outdated "old database" to showcase data analysis capabilities to
                potential customers. This solution was limited in access and didn't reflect Ledger's current platform and dataset.</li><br>
                <li><b>Data Science Bottleneck:</b> Valuable research conducted by the data science team was siloed, lacking a dedicated platform
                for sharing insights with actuaries on the customer side. This resulted in time-consuming efforts creating custom PDFs
                and answering basic questions on customer calls.</li><br>
                <li><b>Limited Brand Awareness:</b> Without a centralized resource, Ledger appeared as a "black box" to many, hindering customer
                understanding and trust.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <img class="work-img" src="work-img/database-2.png">

            <p class="work-content2">
              To identify the full potential of the industry database, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of existing resource
              pages and knowledge bases. This research extended beyond the insurance industry, examining acclaimed examples from
              companies like Redfin and Stripe. We also looked within the car insurance industry, analyzing GetJerry's extensive car
              insurance database.
              <br><br>
              This competitive research revealed several key benefits beyond simply presenting data:
            </p>
              
            <ul class="mb5">
              <li><b>Industry Authority:</b> A well-designed database could position Ledger as a thought leader within the insurance industry.</li><br>
              <li><b>Enhanced Credibility:</b> Providing valuable resources fosters trust and establishes Ledger as a reliable data source.</li><br>
              <li><b>User Engagement:</b> A compelling user experience fosters exploration and deeper engagement with Ledger's services.</li>
            </ul>

            <img class="work-img" src="work-img/database-3.png">
            <p class="work-content2">
              Initially, I experimented with the concept of a "Ledger Library" to centralize existing materials. This involved
              collaborating with some engineers to explore various options, including pre-built documentation software. We also
              considered housing additional resources beyond written content, such as company videos and sales presentation slides.
              <br><br>
              However, after careful evaluation, we determined a custom-built solution would best serve Ledger's needs. This approach
              offered several advantages:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li><b>Tailored Functionality:</b> A custom platform could cater to the specific needs of Ledger's data and diverse audience
                segments. This includes a section for user who are logged in to access locked content.</li><br>
                <li><b>Scalability and Flexibility:</b> Building from scratch allowed for future expansion and integration of additional resources
                beyond the initial focus.</li><br>
                <li><b>Seamless User Experience:</b> Custom development facilitated a cohesive user experience that seamlessly integrates with the
                existing Ledger website.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p class="work-content">
                While pre-built solutions offered convenience, the custom approach ultimately provided a more comprehensive and
                adaptable platform for Ledger's evolving needs.
              </p>
              
            </p>
            <img class="work-img" src="work-img/database-1.png">
            <p class="work-content2">
              To explore the potential of the "Ledger Library" concept, I collaborated with Ben from the data science team. We
              leveraged some of their existing white papers as a starting point. This collaboration allowed us to develop a prototype
              showcasing the core functionality of the Library, including:
            </p>
              
            <ul>
              <li><b>Centralized Storage:</b> Organization and easy access to the Data Science team's valuable research papers.</li><br>
              <li><b>Interactive Elements:</b> The prototype incorporated interactive "labs" as potential tools for user engagement. These labs would have code snippets that users could
                run on their own machines based on Jupiter notebooks.</li>
            </ul>
              
            <p class="work-content">
              While the Library concept ultimately evolved into 2 separate database, this initial exploration with Ben proved valuable
              in solidifying the need for a knowledge hub.
            </p>
              

        <h3 id="part-2" class="work-title">02. The old database</h3>
            <p class="work-content">
              The Industry Database project built upon the groundwork established by the founding team's "legacy database." This
              initial platform, though never officially released, leveraged publicly available data on insurance companies' financial
              reports. It served as a valuable foundational resource for investors, offering insights into the insurance industry
              landscape.
            </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/database-4.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              While the legacy database wasn't officially launched, its data and charts proved valuable to the sales team. These
              elements functioned as a powerful pre-release sales tool, allowing them to showcase Ledger's capabilities in data
              gathering and analysis to potential customers. This unofficial use case highlighted the clear need for a more accessible
              and comprehensive platform, ultimately leading to the development of the Industry Database.
            </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/database-5.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              The legacy database also housed a significant amount of data science writing by Ledger co-founder Julien. However, this
              valuable resource remained largely unseen due to the platform's limited accessibility. This untapped potential for
              sharing insights with a wider audience became a key driver for the development of the Industry Database project.
            </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/database-6.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              While the legacy database offered a glimpse into Ledger's data analysis capabilities, it wasn't designed for ongoing
              knowledge sharing. Recognizing this limitation, the Data Science team independently created their own online resource –
              a wiki – to compile their research and writing.<br><br>
              <i>Note: While this resource shared some characteristics with a wiki, it is <b>not</b> a wiki as it does not offer collaborative editing features.
              I also helped Mark create the above design for the print version of the data science publications.</i>
            </p>

        <h3 id="part-3" class="work-title">03. Design</h3>
            <p class="work-content2">
              The project's core objective was to unify scattered data and resources into a user-friendly platform accessible on the
              Ledger website. This centralized hub aimed to achieve three key results that we would measure success against:
            </p>
              
            <ul>
              <li><b>Enhanced Accessibility:</b> Replicate the charts and data from the old database, making it readily available for both
              customers and non-customers.</li><br>
              <li><b>Knowledge Sharing:</b> Establish a dedicated space for academic content like data science papers, fostering knowledge
              sharing and transparency.</li><br>
              <li><b>Thought Leadership:</b> Leverage the database as a public resource, positioning Ledger as a valuable industry resource and
              thought leader.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="work-content">
              With a multitude of potential starting points, I collaborated closely with Michael, the project manager, to establish a
              strategic direction. While data science writing held value, we ultimately decided to prioritize the industry data
              section. This decision was driven by the data and charts' powerful ability to deliver immediate impact and align with all goals.
              <br><br>
              This focus on data ensured the project hit the ground running, meeting all three initial objectives. Following this
              success, we planned to continue development on the data science writing section, creating a comprehensive knowledge
              library in the future.
            </p>

              Our post-hackathon focus was refining the Industry Database MVP. We prioritized enhancing charts for clarity and worked
              towards complete data parity with the old database, ensuring users have access to all historical information. This
              commitment to continuous improvement keeps the Industry Database delivering valuable user insights.

              The old database excelled in presenting data geographically. Recognizing this user preference, we explored advanced
              techniques for translating a wider range of data series into compelling geo-visualizations. This involved experimenting
              with mapping various metrics, aiming to provide users with even richer insights into industry trends across different
              geographic locations.

              To cater to our investor user base, we explored incorporating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlestick_chart">candlestick charts</a> on the Insurer detail page. These
              charts, a familiar format for financial data analysis, would have enabled investors to visualize historical stock price
              movements and make more informed investment decisions.

              While the initial launch of the Industry Database focused on core functionalities, a wealth of exciting ideas remain on
              the horizon. These include:
            </p>
              
            <ul>
              <li><b>Company Spotlights:</b> Dedicated sections showcasing specific insurers or Lines of Business would provide users with
              in-depth explorations of industry leaders or emerging trends within a particular sector.</li><br>
              <li><b>Industry Trend Visualization:</b> Interactive charts and graphs could be implemented to dynamically illustrate historical
              and projected changes across the entire industry and individual LOBs.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="work-content">
              These enhancements would further empower users to delve deeper into the data, fostering a richer understanding of the
              insurance landscape.
