          Imagine trying to protect your website from a potential cyberattack, but your firewall's advanced features are locked behind a maze of complexity. 
          This was the reality for many Cloudflare users, where the power of the Cloudflare Firewall custom rules wasn't fully accessible due to a
          challenging user experience. Cloudflare Firewall app is a critical security tool for many of our users, but accessing its advanced features was 
          a challenge for many of our users. This project aimed to simplify the firewall custom rules experience for all customer segments, from 
          enterprise teams to free plan users.

            <p class="work-content">
              The frustration of spam emails fueled Cloudflare's creation. The founders (Matthew, Michelle, and Lee) aimed to build a solution that could intercept
              and prevent this unwanted traffic. While Cloudflare's basic firewall is user-friendly and sufficient for basic needs,
              users seeking more control and precision face a significant hurdle: figuring out where to begin.
            </p>

            <div class="blog-callout">
              <ul>
                <h3>Key problems</h3>
                <li>Limited Accessibility: Powerful firewall settings were previously inaccessible to most users, requiring manual
                  internal team
                  intervention and lot of back-and-forth emails.</li>
                <li>Complex Setup: Custom firewall configurations were cumbersome and time-consuming, even for technical users.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>



          <img class="work-img" src="work-img/firewall-1.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              The starting point for custom WAF (Web Application Firewall) rules was a frustrating dead end: a prompt to "Please
              contact our team." This meant relying on Cloudflare's internal team to manually configure your rules, and any changes
              required repeating the entire process.
            </p>

          <img class="work-img" src="work-img/firewall-2.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              Traffic data for the Firewall page was telling. A significant portion (labeled user as "None") represented interactions with our
              internal team building custom rules for customers. This highlighted the inefficiency of the existing system.
            </p>
          
          <h3 id="part-2" class="work-title">02. Research</h3>
            <p class="work-content">
              Our core goal was to shift control back to the user. This meant designing a user interface that enabled users to
              create and manage their own custom firewall rules, eliminating the need for internal support and minimizing friction in
              the user experience
            </p>

          <img class="work-img" src="work-img/firewall-3.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              To understand the best approach for the custom firewall rule builder, we conducted a comprehensive comparative research
              analysis. We evaluated a wide range of existing rule builders, including operating system tools and third-party
              extensions. This exploration helped us identify the core components and user interactions that were most effective and
              intuitive.
            </p>
          <img class="work-img" src="work-img/firewall-5.png">
              <p class="work-content">
                Analyzing existing rule builders revealed a spectrum of approaches. Some were overly complex, while others relied
                heavily on visual elements and metaphors. Our challenge was to identify the core functionalities essential for Cloudflare's custom WAF
                rule builder. Striking a balance was key: ensuring ease of use for beginners while not compromising the precise control
                desired by technical users who might leverage a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for advanced customization.
              </p>
          <img class="work-img" src="work-img/firewall-4.png">
              <p class="work-content">
                To gain a deep understanding of the existing workflow and user needs, I collaborated with internal sales engineer who
                built custom firewall rules for our key customers. By discussing firewall functionalities and the level of customization
                required, I was able to grasp the complexity and scope of the solution needed. This collaborative approach proved
                valuable: the flow chart I created to visualize the firewall process was even adopted by the sales engineer to explain
                the product to enterprise clients.
              </p>
          
          
          <h3 id="part-3" class="work-title">03. Analysis</h3>
            <p class="work-content">
              Armed with a solid understanding of the firewall's functionality and having explored diverse rule builder approaches, it
              was time to move on to the next phase: evaluating which elements would best fit our user needs and the Cloudflare
              experience.
            </p>
          <img class="work-img" src="work-img/firewall-6.png">
            <p class="work-content">
            To ensure a seamless user experience, I began by mapping out the overall workflow for creating, reading, updating, and
            deleting (CRUD) firewall rules. This user flow analysis helped us identify the different UI components needed to support
            each stage of the process effectively.
            </p>
          <img class="work-img" src="work-img/firewall-7.png">
            <p class="work-content">
            The visual interface, a key component of the rule builder, needed to provide clear and intuitive functionality. I
            focused on breaking down the core elements: defining actions triggered by user-selected events. These triggers could be
            either additive (including specific elements) or subtractive (excluding elements), depending on the chosen operand (data
            point used in the rule).
            </p>

            <img class="work-img" src="work-img/firewall-14b.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              To accommodate the full range of potential customizations, we brainstormed and prototyped various options for each
              filter function section. This exploration ensured we could address diverse user needs. Additionally, I experimented
              with a drag-and-drop functionality for visually reordering rules, a feature frequently requested by customers for easier
              rule management.
            </p>


          <h3 id="part-4" class="work-title">04. Testing</h3>
            <p class="work-content2">
              To ensure the user interface (UI) effectively addressed customer needs, I collaborated with engineers and the
              London-based engineering and sales team. Through paper prototyping sessions, we gained valuable insights into how both teams interpreted
              customer wants and translated them into actionable design decisions. This teamwork led to the development of several key
              UI components:
              </p>
              <ul class="mb5">
                <li>Enhanced feedback mechanisms that provided users with clearer information on existing firewall rules and their
                effectiveness.</li><br>
                <li>A basic rule builder prototype that allowed users to switch between the visual interface and a dedicated Domain Specific
                Language (DSL) view. This addressed the needs of both technical and non-technical users.</li>
              </ul>

          <img class="work-img" src="work-img/firewall-11.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              In collaboration with Firewall Product Manager Alex, we conducted a customer pain point and priority analysis. This analysis
              helped us define the scope of work for the initial launch (round one). By focusing on the most critical user needs, we
              were able to prioritize features for round one and identify those best suited for a fast follow-up update in the next
              release.
            </p>


          <h3 id="part-5" class="work-title">05. Design</h3>

          <img class="work-img" src="work-img/firewall-15.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              To prioritize user adoption for the initial launch, we opted for a streamlined rule builder design. This meant
              strategically deferring the drag-and-drop functionality for reordering conditionals. 
            </p>
          <img class="work-img" src="work-img/firewall-15b.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              To ensure the rule builder's interaction design was intuitive, I created a series of simple HTML prototypes showcasing
              different variations. This iterative prototyping allowed for early user feedback and helped refine the final interface.
              You can experience <a href="..\..\projects\fbf-test\index1_basic.html">a simplified prototype</a> in my side-project section.

          <img class="work-img" src="work-img/firewall-15c.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              In conjunction with the revamped WAF rule builder, we implemented additional feedback mechanisms and data points. This
              empowered users with greater visibility into their firewall's effectiveness. Users could now access valuable insights
              such as the impact of specific rules and the overall performance of their firewall.
            </p>
          <img class="work-img" src="work-img/firewall-15d.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              Additionally, features like rate-limited notifications and an event log provided real-time awareness of triggered rules,
              allowing for proactive management and fine-tuning of security measures.
            </p>


          <h3 id="part-6" class="work-title">06. Results</h3>

            <p class="work-content2">The redesigned custom firewall experience yielded positive results, providing valuable insights for future iterations.
            Here's a quantitative look at the impact:</p>
            <p class="work-content">
            <b>High User Engagement:</b> Within the first 6 days of launch, nearly 4,000 users actively participated by creating a new
            custom rule. Over half (over 2,000 users) successfully completed the rule creation process, saving and deploying at
            least one rule. This suggests the core user experience resonated well with a significant portion of the user base.
            </p>
          <img class="work-img" src="work-img/firewall-17.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              <b>Areas for Optimization:</b> The 60% conversion rate for creating custom rules offers an opportunity to further
              improve the user experience. Analyzing user behavior can pinpoint specific areas where users might encounter friction, allowing
              for targeted improvements in subsequent follow up Firewall design.
            </p>
              
          <img class="work-img" src="work-img/firewall-16.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              <b>Advanced User Success:</b> For highly technical users, the new DSL expression editor proved valuable. While a smaller
              group (approximately 350 users) explored this advanced feature, a significant percentage (aproximately 200 users) successfully created 
              and deployed custom rules using the editor.

            </p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Initial Inquiry Spike:</b> As expected, the launch week saw a temporary increase in support tickets (21 tickets), likely due
                to users familiarizing themselves with the new features. However, this initial rise was quickly followed by a
                substantial decrease.</li><br>
                <li><b>Sustainable Reduction:</b> Just two weeks after launch, support tickets related to firewall rules dropped by 33%
                week-over-week (33 tickets). This downward trend continued, with a further 28% reduction the following week (13
                tickets).</li>
