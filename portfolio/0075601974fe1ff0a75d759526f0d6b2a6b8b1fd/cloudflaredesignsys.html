          I joined Cloudflare back in 2016, where we were only 2 designers. Cloudflare at that point was based on some of the original designs that they came up with back
          in 2011, even the logo at the time felt like the early 2000s. One of the projects we were eager to get to once we had completed the 2016 rebranding was to 
          make design more consistent and easier for engineers to work with. To start that we wanted to implement a design system.

          <p class="work-content">
            The first place to start for the design system was a quick audit of the current landscape. At this time, we would be primarily focused on the Cloudflare platform.
            The marketing design team would handle setting up the rules and regulations for the marketing website (everything before you sign in), the part that product design
            team would cover would be the "platform" or everything after you sign in.
          </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/cfds-1.png">
          <p class="work-content">
            We looked at how the contrast and readability for our text over background based on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 at the AA level. 
            Across many main pages..
          </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/cfds-2.png">
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/cfds-3.png">
          <p class="work-content">
            ...and components. We also looked at the number of background colors that were being used. We started to notice things such as 11 different grey background that
            varied from page to page inconsistently. It was a good wake up call for us as the designers and the front-end teams who looked to design for consitency.
          </p>

        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/cfds-3b.png">
          <p class="work-content">
            Here are some results from the audit. For the top nav bar and buttons there were already this many variations that only were slightly different and definitely single use.

        <h3 id="part-2" class="work-title">02. System</h3>
          <p class="work-content">
            This laid out the foundational research and work we put into creating Cloudflare's first design system, also known as the "CF-UI".
          </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/cfds-4.png">
          <p class="work-content">
            We worked with both front-end engineers and marketing designers to simplify the colors and fonts used on the platform closely to match the styles that were used on the
            marketing pages.
          </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/cfds-5.png">
          <p class="work-content">
            We documented new components and component behaviors so that engineers could build them out regardless of which team they belong to with the same
            language, color, and styles.
          </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/cfds-6.png">

        <h3 id="part-3" class="work-title">03. Accessibility</h3>
          <p class="work-content">
            One part of the design system that I focused my attention a lot more on was accessibility on our data visualizations. We wanted to have a structued system
            of colors and guidelines for how we represented data in charts and diagrams that would be easy to work with and read, regardless of how our customers vision was.
          </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/cfds-8.png">
          <p class="work-content">
            I put time into researching colors for data visualizations including cartographic data (check out <a href="https://colorbrewer2.org/">ColorBrewers</a> by Cynthia Brewer) and interviewed
            color-blind designers to better understand how colors could be used to enable all our users.
          </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/cfds-9.png">
          <p class="work-content">
            I created mock visualizations on different color schemes ranging from monochromatic to qualitative to show the team how we can best show data on our platform.
          </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/cfds-10.png">
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/cfds-11.png">
          <p class="work-content">
            A lot of this was build in simple front-end prototypes that allowed for rapid changes and scaling into different number of metrics.
          </p>
        <img class="work-img" src="work-img/cfds-12.png">
          <p class="work-content">
            From the result of this, we were able to update and build new chart/graph components as a part of the CF-UI component library that supported
            a color set that was the most accessible to many of our users.
