          While at <a href="runscope.html">Runscope</a>, my primary project was to work with Justin K. on Ghost Inspector. Ghost Inspector was a browser based
          way to do front end testing using DOM elements. You could "record" a specific flow across pages and different interactions on the DOM and schedule
          runs on this test. If anything on the DOM was different from what was "recorded" it would note the difference and update the developer. <br><br> At the
          time, Runscope had just aquired Ghost Inspector to be a part of the larger company offering, Justin had been working on the project on his own for a while
          and had me assisting with design and UX on both the front end and platform.

            <p class="work-content">
              One of the first things I worked on was revamping the website. One of the main things was to start updating the look and feel so that
              Ghost Inspector started to feel like a part of the Runscope suite of tools. That meant update the style and components to match.
            </p>
      <img class="work-img" src="work-img/ghost-1.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              The website itself wasn't too complicated, there were only a handful of pages. Some key parts were to have a similar styled
              header and footer as on the main Runscope webpage.
            </p>
      <img class="work-img" src="work-img/ghost-2.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              Another part that I worked on was also updating the site to be more responsive and mobile friendly. We wanted to have a seemless 
              experience regardless of what type of device you were viewing the website on.
            </p>
      <img class="work-img" src="work-img/ghost-3.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              I simplified the branding and color palette to give the same minimalist feel as the Runscope branding.
            </p>
      
      
      <h3 id="part-2" class="work-title">02. Platform</h3>
            <p class="work-content">
              While working on the website, the other major work was to improve the UX on the Ghost Inspector platform. The platform was very
              functional, but didn't have the best flow and affordances. We've had feedback that some features were't easy to find, or that
              labeling wasn't as clear in some situations.
            </p>
      <img class="work-img" src="work-img/ghost-4.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              Taking a look via an audit allowed me to understand the possible user flows across the platform. This informed me of where each job
              that the user might want to do would begin and end. Then we reviewed where these flows might be disrupted or user get stuck. <br><br> Some
              times all that's needed is to update the navigation and path. Othertimes the fixes were a lot more changes to the layout.
            </p>
      <img class="work-img" src="work-img/ghost-5.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              A lot of the updates were around the feedback and prompts for the user. We needed for them to understand if something was successful, why was
              it successful. If something failed, why did it fail? Making sure that the feedback was as clear as possible and that there would be links
              towards documentation where applicable.
            </p>
      
      
      <h3 id="part-3" class="work-title">03. Documentation</h3>
            <p class="work-content">
              A new part of the Ghost Inspector was more emphasis on supporting the new and existing users with documenation and help. We updated the
              documentation section on the website with new sections, videos, and how to get in contact with the now larger support team.

      <h3 id="part-4" class="work-title">04. Marketing</h3>
            <p class="work-content">
              I also worked on a number of blogs, marketing campagins and printed work for Ghost Inspector.

              Some of the blog and web content we turned into a one-pager to be handed out at events. Working with the team we assembled a draft and worked 
              across several revisions before the finalized print out.
