          While at Runscope, my primary project was to work with Justin K. on Ghost Inspector. Ghost
          Inspector was a browser-based way to perform front-end testing using DOM elements. You could "record" a specific flow across 
          pages and different interactions on the DOM and schedule runs for this test. If anything on the DOM was different from what was 
          "recorded," it would note the difference and update the developer.
        </p>
        <p class="lh-copy mb6">
          At the time, Runscope had just acquired Ghost Inspector to be part of the larger company offering. Justin had been
          working on the project on his own for a while and had me assisting with design and UX on both the front end and
          platform.

      <h3 id="part-1" class="work-title mt5">01. Website</h3>
            <p class="work-content">
              One of the first things I worked on was revamping the website. One of the main goals was to start updating the look and
              feel so that Ghost Inspector started to feel like a part of the Runscope suite of tools. That meant updating the style
              and components to match.
            </p>
      <img class="work-img" src="work-img/ghost-1.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              The website itself wasn't too complicated; there were only a handful of pages. Some key parts were to have a similarly
              styled header and footer as on the main Runscope webpage.
            </p>
      <img class="work-img" src="work-img/ghost-2.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              Another part that I worked on was also updating the site to be more responsive and mobile-friendly. We wanted to have a
              seamless experience regardless of what type of device you were viewing the website on.
            </p>
      <img class="work-img" src="work-img/ghost-3.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              I simplified the branding and color palette to give the same minimalist feel as the Runscope branding.
            </p>
      
      
      <h3 id="part-2" class="work-title">02. Platform</h3>
            <p class="work-content">
              While working on the website, the other major work was to improve the UX on the Ghost Inspector platform. The platform
              was very functional but didn't have the best flow and affordances. We received feedback that some features weren't easy
              to find, or that labeling wasn't as clear in some situations.
            </p>
      <img class="work-img" src="work-img/ghost-4.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              Taking a look via an audit allowed me to understand the possible user flows across the platform. This informed me of
              where each task that the user might want to do would begin and end. Then we reviewed where these flows might be
              disrupted or users get stuck.<br><br>Sometimes all that's needed is to update the navigation and path. Other times the fixes were a lot more changes to the
              layout.
            </p>
      <img class="work-img" src="work-img/ghost-5.png">
            <p class="work-content">
              Many of the updates were focused on the feedback and prompts for the user. We needed them to understand if something was
              successful, why it was successful. If something failed, why did it fail? Making sure that the feedback was as clear as
              possible and that there would be links to documentation where applicable.
            </p>
      
      
      <h3 id="part-3" class="work-title">03. Documentation</h3>
            <p class="work-content">
              A new part of Ghost Inspector was more emphasis on supporting new and existing users with documentation and help. We
              updated the documentation section on the website with new sections, videos, and how to get in contact with the now
              larger support team.

      <h3 id="part-4" class="work-title">04. Marketing</h3>
            <p class="work-content">
              I also worked on a number of blogs, marketing campaigns, and printed work for Ghost Inspector.

              Some of the blog and web content we turned into a one-pager to be handed out at events. Working with the team, we
              assembled a draft and worked across several revisions before the finalized printout.

              For some special events (like AWS re:Invent), we created specific landing pages for promotional pricing.
