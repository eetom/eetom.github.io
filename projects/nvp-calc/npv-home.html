                <h2>What is Net Present Value?</h2>
                <p>One of the things I've learnt about working in investing and finance is the concept of 
                    "Net present value". This is a way for investors to evaulate across multiple years the value of long term investments.
                </p>
                    To understand NPV, you need to do some math to calculate the "Present Value" of each round of returns (Future Value). 
                    This is because capital ("money") has different value today in your hands versus promised tomorrow. Money today is worth 
                    more as it can be used or invested. Once invested, it requires time to build up interest.
                <p>
                </p>

                            Net present value (NPV) is the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of
                            cash outflows over a period of time. NPV is used in capital budgeting and investment planning to analyze the
                            profitability of a projected investment or project. <br><br>
                
                            NPV is the result of calculations that find the current value of a future stream of payments using the
                            proper discount rate. In general, projects with a positive NPV are worth undertaking, while those with a negative NPV are
                            not.”

                <h2>How to calculate NPV</h2>
                <p>The first thing to understand is what we mean by "Present Value". Present value is the value of future returns adjusted to 
                    the value today. It's important to understand that money we have in our pocket today is worth <italic>more</italic> than money 
                    promised to us tomorrow because we can't use it to make more potential returns if it's already in "use".
                </p>

                <div class="math-box">
                    <p>Question: How much money would I have in 1 year if I invest $100 at with an expected return of 10% per year?</p>
                    $$ {$100 \times 1.1 = \color{red}{$110}}$$
                    $$ {PV \times (1 + i) = FV}$$
                    <p>$110 would be the <b>Future Value</b> of my investment</p>
                </div>

                <div class="math-box">
                    <p>Question: How much money would I have would I have to invest at an expected return of 10% per year to end up with $110?</p>
                    $$ {$110 / 1.1 = \color{red}{$100}}$$
                    $$ {FV / (1 + i) = PV}$$
                    <p>$100 would be the <b>Present Value</b> of that investment</p>
                </div>
                <p class="mb5"></p>
                <p>Now let's try out this formula for 2 years. With the second year, the amount of return would compound. Meaning that we start
                the second year with more than $100 base, we also have the $10 that we had earned at the end of the first year.

                    Now for something more challenging, let's look a the <b>NET Present Value</b> of an investment over 4 years. The NET present value is to calculate
                    the overall value of an investment with consideration of the inital cost. If the NPV is positive, then it's worth it, if it's negative then it won't
                    be a good investment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Starting off with an investment that costs $1000 today, and will pay back $400 every year for 4 years. We'll assume that the
                    WACC (Weight average cost of capital) is 20%.

                    $$ {NPV = \color{red}{$35}} $$
                </div>

                <p>Since the NPV is <b>POSITIVE</b> based on the WACC used, we can confirm that this is an investment worthwhile that will beat
                just putting our money directly into a US Treasurey bond. In the case that the NPV is negative means that we could have made more
                money with a shorter investment or higher returns earlier. This reinforces the concept that time is money, and money today can 
                be put work today so can be worth more than money that is in our pocket yet.
                </p>

                <p>And there you have it, you're now well on your way to becoming rich beyond your wildest dreams. Or something like that..
                    At least you now know how to calculate investment value!

                <h1>NPV solvers</h1>
                <p>With the base understanding of how NPV works, I've created 2 variations of NPV calculators.
                    The first created with HTML and Javascript can only calculate with a consistent future value return.
                    The second one created in React with the help of my friend Jason can dynamically adjust for different
                    future values of return.
