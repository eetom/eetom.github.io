          <p class="contacts2">Dear Mr. McCann,</p>
          <p class="contacts2">
            The pyramids were impressive, but imagine building them with the digital tools of today! Bluebeam's vision for a
            connected construction industry excites me. As a designer who is passionate about technology, I'm eager to collaborate
            with talented teams at the intersection of these fields. Bluebeamâ€™s vision for efficient and safe work sites through
            smart and connected technology is exactly the shakeup the construction industry needs!
          </p>
          
          <p class="contacts2">
            My name is Eric and I'm interested in the Senior Product Designer position at Bluebeam to help build that future, today!
          </p>
          
          <p class="contacts2">
          In my previous companies, I've excelled at:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Understanding user needs:</b> Through user interviews and research, I develop a deep understanding of user pain points and
            translate them into design solutions.</li>
            <li><b>Building solid design systems:</b> I have built 2 cohesive design systems that ensure a consistent and user-friendly
            experience across platforms.</li>
            <li><b>Bringing ideas to life:</b> From wireframes to high-fidelity mockups, I can translate complex concepts into clear and
            intuitive interfaces.</li>
            <li><b>Collaboration:</b> I thrive in collaborative environments, working seamlessly with engineers and product teams to bring
            designs to life.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          
          <p class="contacts2">
            My portfolio at <a href="eetom.github.io/portfolio/portfolio.html">eetom.github.io/portfolio/portfolio.html</a> (Password: mischief managed) showcases a variety of design
            projects that demonstrate my skills and experience. I'm confident that I can make a strong contribution to the Bluebeam product design team and I'm eager to learn more about this opportunity.
          </p>
          <p class="contacts2">Thank you for your time and consideration.<br>
          Sincerely,</p>
