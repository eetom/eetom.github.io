      <p>To: Hiring @ Windows Cloud Experiences Design team<br>
        Re: Senior Product designer (Job number: 1691078)</p>

      <p>
        Hello! My name is Eric Tsai, a product designer with 10+ years of experience creating designs that
        enriches user experience while balancing with company business goals.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Windows Cloud Experiences team's mission to empower users to be productive on any cloud-connected device while
        creating software that people love deeply resonates with me. I believe in the power of technology to not only be
        functional but also to make a positive impact. I'm eager to collaborate with the talented teams at Cloud Experience to
        create innovative technology that connects devices and contributes to a better web for everyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        At AWS, I wasn't just designing tools - I was building bridges for developers! Leveraging my user research and
        information architecture skills, I led the design of features like third-party integrations, allowing developers to
        seamlessly connect their preferred tools to the AWS cloud platform. We also built on-platform notification systems to
        keep everyone in the loop and collaborating smoothly. The end result? Streamlined workflows for developers, freeing them
        up to focus on innovation within AWS.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm passionate about designing clear and intuitive user experiences that are effortless to use. My experience crafting
        user journeys ensures a user-centric approach, making me a strong candidate for the Windows Cloud Experience design
        team. I'm particularly interested in the challenge of building for a connected world where accessibility and inclusivity
        are paramount, ensuring everyone can participate.
      </p>
      <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon!<br>
        Sincerely,</p>
