        Re: Product Designer Application</p>
        
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Eric Tsai, a product designer with 10+ years of experience creating designs that enriches user
          experience while balancing with company business goals.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Byte's mission to revolutionize orthodontics with technology deeply resonates with me. Having braces myself, I
          understand the challenges of the traditional process. I'm passionate about using technology to create seamless
          experiences, and Byte's approach perfectly aligns with this passion.
        </p>

        <p>
          At Ledger Investing (insurtech ILS leader), I identified a need for a more efficient customer data system. I spearheaded
          research & design of a centralized admin portal, collaborating with the PM to define functionalities and user jobs.
          Utilizing user research & information architecture, I designed a platform enabling CRUD, program management, and
          cross-team access, boosting efficiency & reducing errors. It also facilitated internal testing of new features and
          streamlining our development process.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe my experience in designing clear and efficient user journeys, along with my passion for user-centric design,
          would be a valuable asset to the Byte/Dentsply Sirona team. I'm particularly interested in applying my skills to improve
          the user experience, specifically focusing on how data can be leveraged to enhance the onboarding process for new
          patients at Byte.
        </p>

        <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
