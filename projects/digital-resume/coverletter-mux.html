          <p class="contacts2">Hey Mux team,</p>
          <p class="contacts2">
            Developer forums shouldnâ€™t be filled with "how do I use this?" threads! As a Sr. product designer, I create intuitive
            interfaces that make developers feel like rockstars, not stuck deciphering cryptic UI.
          </p>
          
          <p class="contacts2">
            With over 10 years of experience, my design process begins with researching user pain-points and working across the product and engineering teams. My end-to-end
            ownership of features at Cloudflare resulted in products that simplified critical firewall workflows and received great
            user feedback and save our teams valuable time.
          </p>
          
          <p class="contacts2">
          <ul>
            <li class="cover-list"><b>Collaboration & Communication:</b> I work well in fast-paced environments, effectively collaborating with product, engineering, and stakeholders to manage
            feedback and lead initiatives independently.</li>
            <li class="cover-list"><b>User Research & Prototyping:</b> I conduct thorough user research (personas, journeys) to understand user needs and translate them into high-fidelity,
            interactive prototypes.</li>
            <li class="cover-list"><b>Design Systems Expertise:</b> I am adept at utilizing and extending design systems like CF-ui and AWS Polaris to maintain design consistency. Even created
            one at Ledger Investing from scratch.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="contacts2 cover-gap">
            I'm confident that I can make a strong contribution to the Mux product design team and and I'm eager to learn more about how I
            can help shape the future of web video!
          </p>
          <p class="contacts2">Thank you for your time and consideration.<br>
          Sincerely,</p>
