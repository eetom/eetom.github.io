          <p class="contacts2">
            Design holds the power to tell impactful stories, and healthcare data has the potential to improve countless lives. 
            Combining these two forces could unlock the key to better patient care and stronger communities.
          </p>
          
          <p class="contacts2">
            As a Senior Product Designer, I've worked on many projects that translate complex data into clear narratives that
            empower professionals to perform at their best and help people around them.
          </p>

          <p class="contacts2">
            With over 10 years of experience, my design process emphasizes on working with the product and engineering teams to build
            intuitive and user-centric designs.
          </p>

          <p class="contacts2">
          <ul class="big-list">
            <li class="cover-list"><b>Collaboration & Communication:</b> I work well in fast-paced environments, effectively collaborating with product, engineering, and stakeholders to manage
            feedback and lead initiatives independently.</li>
            <li class="cover-list"><b>User Research & Prototyping:</b> I conduct thorough user research (personas, journeys) to understand user needs and translate them into high-fidelity,
            interactive prototypes.</li>
            <li class="cover-list"><b>Design Systems Expertise:</b> I am adept at utilizing and extending design systems like CF-ui and AWS Polaris to maintain design consistency. Even created
            one at Ledger Investing from scratch.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="contacts2 cover-gap">
          Right now, what I'm looking for is to grow alongside a team that is also pushing the boundaries of what impact design
          can have on our world today. I'm confident my skills and experience in user research, data visualization, and design
          systems would be a valuable asset to the Providence design team. I'm eager to discuss how I can help advance the future
          of healthcare!
          </p>
          <p class="contacts2">Thank you for your time and consideration.<br>
          Sincerely,</p>
