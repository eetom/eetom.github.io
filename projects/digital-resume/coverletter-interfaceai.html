        Re: Senior Product Designer Application</p>
        
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Eric Tsai, a product designer with 10+ years of experience creating designs that enriches user
          experience while balancing with company business goals.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I'm very interested in Interface.ai's mission to revolutionize the financial service industry with cutting-edge natural
          language technology. By focusing on engaging customer service experiences powered by intelligent conversational
          interfaces, Interface.ai empowers customers with the confidence and trust they need to navigate financial institutions
          effectively. As someone with a passion for technology and a strong design background, I'm eager to collaborate with your
          team to create friendly and helpful customer experiences at the intersection of these two fields.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my previous role at AWS, I led the design of several developer tools and AWS features. Leveraging my user research
          and information architecture skills, I designed and help launched features like third-party integrations and on-platform
          notifications. These features streamlined user workflows and ensured a consistent experience across multiple interaction
          points for developers.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe my experience in designing clear and efficient user journeys, along with my passion for user-centric design,
          would be a valuable asset to the Interface.ai design team. I'm particularly interested in applying my expertise in
          complex user journey design to develop intuitive and engaging conversational UI flows that empower users to navigate
          financial services with confidence.
        </p>

        <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <h3 class="signature-cover">Eric Tsai</h3>
