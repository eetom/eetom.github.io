          <p class="contacts2">Hello Mr. Huang,</p>
          <p class="contacts2">
            A well-designed in-car interface is like a beautiful symphony â€“ each element working together in harmony to enhance the
            drive not distract from it. I believe the best way to achieve this harmony is through creative UX design that is easy to understand,
            quick to adjust, and blends into the background.
          </p>
          
          <p class="contacts2">
            With over 10 years of experience, I've consistently delivered by researching user pain-points and working with the product and engineering teams.
            My end-to-end ownership of features at Cloudflare resulted in products that simplified complex firewall workflows and
            received strong positive user feedback.
          </p>
          
          <p class="contacts2">
          In my previous companies, I've excelled at:
          <ul>
            <li class="cover-list"><b>Collaboration & Communication:</b> I work well in fast-paced environments, effectively collaborating with product, engineering, and stakeholders to manage
            feedback and lead initiatives independently.</li>
            <li class="cover-list"><b>User Research & Prototyping:</b> I conduct thorough user research (personas, journeys) to understand user needs and translate them into high-fidelity,
            interactive prototypes.</li>
            <li class="cover-list"><b>Design Systems Expertise:</b> I am adept at utilizing and extending design systems like CF-ui and AWS Polaris to maintain design consistency. Even created
            one at Ledger Investing from scratch.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="contacts2 cover-gap">
            I'm confident that I can make a strong contribution to the Porsche digital design team and I'm eager to learn more about
            this opportunity to impact the future of digital car UI.
          </p>
          <p class="contacts2">Thank you for your time and consideration.<br>
          Sincerely,</p>
          <h3 class="signature-cover">Eric Tsai</h3>
