          <p class="contacts2">Dear ,</p>
          <p class="contacts2">
            In today's digital landscape, fragmentation can be a barrier. As a designer, I believe in building bridges, not walls.
            The Web Experience Collectives's mission to "imagine the future of web and Windows experiences" deeply inspires me as an opportunity to 
            build the future web that connects people from around the world.
          </p>
          
          <p class="contacts2">
            The Microsoft WXC' mission to build a web that works for everyone deeply resonates with me. I
            am a big believer of an open web that is inclusive and easy to use as a vital part of our daily lives. I have a passion
            for technology but come from an design background and so I want to collaborate and work with smart people help solve
            problems to build a better web.
          </p>
          
          <p class="contacts2">
            I come from 10+ years of experience in startups and larger companies honed my ability to adapt and collaborate. At
            Cloudflare, I led research and redesign of critical security and data features, improving user experience for thousands. 
            This made Cloudflare's security solutions more accessible, contributing to a safer web for all.
          </p>
          
          <p class="contacts2">
            Thank you for your time and consideration. My work experience, coupled with my desire to build not only good products
            but products that do good, would make me a great fit for the product designer position on the team.
          <br>
          <p class="contacts2">Sincerely,</p>
