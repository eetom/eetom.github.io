        <p>To: Acho team<br>
        Re: Product designer @ Acho</p>
        <p>Hello! My name is Eric Tsai, a product designer with 10+ years of experience creating user-centric designs
        that elevate user experience while balancing with business goals. I'm particularly interested in Acho's focus on making data
        products more user-friendly and accessible. Empowering people through data visualization is a passion of mine, and 
        I believe Acho's mission to make data actionable truly resonates with me.</p>

        <p>
        In my previous role at Ledger Investing, a leading fintech startup, I led research and redesign efforts to improve user
        flows for key features, resulting in increased user engagement for both internal and external customers.
        My expertise in user-centered design and my passion for creating clear and intuitive data visualizations align perfectly 
        with Acho's mission to empower users through user-centric data products.
        </p>
        
        <p>I'm very impressed by the positive customer testimonials highlighting the positive impact of Acho's interface and user
        experience and I'm confident that my skills and experience would be a valuable asset to your team as you continue to refine
        and enhance the user experience of Acho's products.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <h3 class="signature-cover">Eric Tsai</h3>
