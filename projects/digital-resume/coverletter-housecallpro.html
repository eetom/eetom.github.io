        Re: Product designer II @ Housecall pro</p>

        <p>
        Hello! My name is Eric Tsai, a results-oriented product designer with 10+ years of experience creating designs that
        enriches user experience while balancing with company business goals.
        </p>

        <p>
        Housecall Pro's mission to empower home service professionals deeply resonates with me. As a homeowner, I understand the
        challenges of finding qualified professionals and scheduling appointments efficiently. These are areas where Housecall
        Pro makes a real difference.I have a passion for technology but come from an design background and so I want to
        collaborate and work with smart people in the intersection of both to create not only good software, but software that
        does good in the world.
        </p>

        <p>
        Previously, at Ledger Investing (insurtech ILS leader), I identified a need for a more efficient customer data system. 
        I led research & design of a centralized admin portal, collaborating with the PM to define functionalities and user jobs.
        Utilizing user research & information architecture, I designed a platform enabling CRUD, program management, and
        cross-team access, boosting efficiency & reducing errors. It also facilitated internal testing of new features and
        streamlining our development process.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        I believe my experience in designing clear and efficient user journeys, along with my passion for user-centric design,
        would be a valuable asset to the Housecall Pro team. I'm particularly interested in applying my skills to improve the
        user experience for service professionals, specifically focusing on how design can enhance scheduling, dispatching, and
        invoicing processes.
        </p>

        <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
