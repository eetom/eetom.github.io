            Re: Senior product designer role</p>

          <br>
          <p class="contacts">Dear Mr. Yu,</p>
          

          <p class="contacts2">
            Something that Iâ€™ve noticed over years of designing products is that enterprise software frequently promises
            frictionless integration and easy set-up, but overloaded and clunky interfaces turn a great product into a mediocre one.
          </p>
          
          <p class="contacts2">
            As a designer with over 10 years of experience that focused on user-centric and intuitive interfaces, I'm all about designing solutions that teams love to
            use, not have to endure. Less time on support, more time getting business done. 
          </p>

          <p class="contacts2">
          <ul class="big-list">
            <li class="cover-list"><b>Collaboration & Communication:</b> I work well in fast-paced environments, effectively collaborating with product, engineering, and stakeholders to manage
            feedback and lead initiatives independently.</li>
            <li class="cover-list"><b>User Research & Prototyping:</b> I conduct thorough user research (personas, journeys) to understand user needs and translate them into high-fidelity,
            interactive prototypes.</li>
            <li class="cover-list"><b>Design Systems Expertise:</b> I am adept at utilizing and extending design systems like CF-ui and AWS Polaris to maintain design consistency. Even created
            one at Ledger Investing from scratch.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="contacts2 cover-gap">
          Clear and streamlined user experiences are key to a successful product, not just features alone. I'm confident my skills
          and experience in user research, prototyping, and design systems would be a valuable asset to the Lexion team and and
          I'm eager to discuss how I can help advance the future of contract management!
          </p>
          <p class="contacts2">Thank you for your time and consideration.<br>
          Sincerely,</p>
          <h3 class="signature-cover">Eric Tsai</h3>
