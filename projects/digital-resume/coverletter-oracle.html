        <p>To: Oracle Health team<br>
        Re: UX designer, Health team</p>
        
        <p>Thank you Jiayan for the introduction.<br><br>
        Hello! My name is Eric Tsai, a product designer with 10+ years of experience creating designs that enriches user
        experience while balancing with company business goals.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        I'm particularly interested in Health team‚Äôs mission to improve the customer experience across different aspects of
        healthcare. I believe that design and technology are at the root to improving the way we interact with the healthcare
        system and it‚Äôs important to design with affordances and give users feedback reinforcement to deliver a clear and
        easy-to-use software. I have a passion for technology but come from an design background and so I want to collaborate
        and work with smart people in the intersection of both create future solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
        In my previous role at Cloudflare, a leading cloud-infrastructure company, I led research and redesign efforts to
        improve user flows for key security features, resulting in improved user experience across multiple product categories,
        from firewalls to self-serve data features across multiple customers categories.
        
        I believe that my experience designing both web & mobile applications and my passion for creating clear and intuitive
        user interfaces that guide users logically through their goals would be a valuable asset to the Oracle Health design team.
        </p>
        
        <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
