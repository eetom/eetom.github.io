          <p class="contacts2">Hello Ms. Weber,</p>
          <p class="contacts2">
            Data is powerful, but it needs a human touch to truly shine. A meticulously designed user experience can change a good
            data tool to an amazing data tool. As a Sr. Product Designer with 10+ years of experience, my role in product teams is to design that differentiating factor by creating experiences
            that are both intuitive and built on user needs.
          </p>
          
          <p class="contacts2">
            Throughout my career, I've centered on researching user pain-points and working with the product and engineering teams.
             My end-to-end ownership of features at Cloudflare resulted in products that simplified complex firewall workflows and 
            recieved strong positive user feedback.
          </p>
          
          <p class="contacts2">
          In my previous companies, I've excelled at:
          <ul>
            <li class="cover-list"><b>Design ownership:</b> Proven ability to manage the entire design process, from opportunity identification to execution with multiple teams.</li>
            <li class="cover-list"><b>Data expertise:</b> Experience designing products within the data space, with a strong understanding of user needs in a variety of data
            workflows and visualizations.</li>
            <li class="cover-list"><b>Design Systems:</b> Adept at utilizing and extending design systems like CF-ui and AWS Polaris to maintain design consistency.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="contacts2 cover-gap">
            I'm confident that I can make a strong contribution to the Snowflake design team and I'm eager to learn more about this
            opportunity to impact the future of data.
          </p>
          <p class="contacts2">Thank you for your time and consideration.<br>
          Sincerely,</p>
          <h3 class="signature-cover">Eric Tsai</h3>
