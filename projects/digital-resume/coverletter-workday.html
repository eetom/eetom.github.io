          <p class="contacts2">
            Complex financial and HR systems are a silent killer of business potential. Workday cuts through that noise,
            streamlining these processes and freeing businesses to focus on what they do best.
          </p>
          
          <p class="contacts2">
          As a designer, I’m a big believer in the power of technology and design to create innovative solutions that make our
          lives and work easier. But it's not just about building good products – it's about building products that do good.
          </p>

          <p class="contacts2">
            That's why I'm drawn to Workday's EDDG. It sounds like a place where I can unleash my full potential alongside a team
            dedicated to continuous growth and excellence while building products that actively impact millions of users.
          </p>

          
          <p class="contacts2">
            With over 10 years of experience, my design process focuses working with the product
            and engineering teams to build intuitive and user-centric designs.
          <ul>
            <li class="cover-list"><b>Collaboration & Communication:</b> I work well in fast-paced environments, effectively collaborating with product, engineering, and stakeholders to manage
            feedback and lead initiatives independently.</li>
            <li class="cover-list"><b>User Research & Prototyping:</b> I conduct thorough user research (personas, journeys) to understand user needs and translate them into high-fidelity,
            interactive prototypes.</li>
            <li class="cover-list"><b>Design Systems Expertise:</b> I am adept at utilizing and extending design systems like CF-ui and AWS Polaris to maintain design consistency. Even created
            one at Ledger Investing from scratch.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="contacts2 cover-gap">
            I'm confident that I can make a strong contribution to the EDDG team and and I'm eager to discuss how I
            can help brighten the future of work!
          </p>
          <p class="contacts2">Thank you for your time and consideration.<br>
          Sincerely,</p>
