        Re: Sr. Product designer, Merchant Order Experience</p>

        <p>
        Hello! My name is Eric Tsai, a product designer with 10+ years of experience creating designs
        that enriches user experience while balancing with company business goals.
        </p>

        <p>
        I'm particularly interested in Doordash's focus on building a customer-centric platform to support and empower businesses. 
        I believe that technology has the power to change the way business is done and lower the barrier of entry so that you don't need to be a mega-corp to have
        access to the business tools and support needed to grow your company. I have a passion for technology but come from an design background 
        and so I want to collaborate and work with smart people who can help solve those problems.
        </p>

        <p>
        In my previous role at Cloudflare, a leading cloud-infrastructure company, I led research and redesign efforts to improve user
        flows for key features, resulting in improved user experience across multiple product categories, from web registrars to 
        self-serve features for free customers. The results were the launches multiple key features and quiet improvement of customer experiences.
        
        I believe that my expertise in design thinking and my passion for creating clear and intuitive user interfaces 
        that guide users seamlessly through their goals would be a valuable asset to the Doordash design team.
        </p>
        
        <p>I'm very impressed by the customer feedback on how quick and easy Doordash is to use, especially for complex tasks like
        live ordering. This goes to show how much thought and effort goes into the user-experience design and product
        at Doordash. I'm very excited for the opportunity of working with the Doordash design team as it feels like user-first
        design is a core value of the company.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <h3 class="signature-cover">Eric Tsai</h3>
