        Re: Senior product designer @ Samsara</p>
        
        <p>
        Hello! My name is Eric Tsai, a product designer with 10+ years of experience creating designs that enriches user
        experience while balancing with company business goals.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        I'm particularly interested in Samsara's focus on creating a platform that impacts the world at a macro level and also invidudals
        at the micro level. This would be a great opportunity to make a real impact via design in the digitization of logisitics and operations.  
        I have a passion for technology but come from an design background and so I want to collaborate and work with smart
        people in the intersection of both create future solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
        In my previous role at Cloudflare, a leading cloud-infrastructure company, I led research and redesign efforts to improve user
        flows for key features, resulting in improved user experience across multiple product categories, from web registrars to 
        self-serve features across multiple customers categories. 
        
        I believe that my experience designing both web & mobile applications and my passion for creating clear and intuitive user interfaces 
        that guide users logically through their goals would be a valuable asset to the Samsara design team.
        </p>
        
        <p>I'm very impressed by the list of awards that Samsara has recently won, espeically the 2024 Best places to work by
          both Glassdoor and Built in. It's important to me that not only is the business growing and the projects challenging but also
          that it's a company where people feel empowered and with a team growing mindset. 
          
        Samsara's focus on customer-centric design resonates deeply with me, and I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute
        to your team's success.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <h3 class="signature-cover">Eric Tsai</h3>
