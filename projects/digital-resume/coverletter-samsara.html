        Re: Senior product designer @ Samsara</p>
        
        <p>Hello! My name is Eric Tsai, a product designer with 10+ years of experience creating user-centric designs
        that elevate user experience while balancing with business goals. 
        
        I'm particularly interested in Shippo's focus on creating a platform to support and empower businesses to get turbo-charged logistics. 
        I believe that technology has the power to democratize and lower the barrier of entry so that you don't need to be a mega-corp to have
        the business tools and support needed to build your company.
        </p>

        <p>
        In my previous role at Cloudflare, a leading cloud-infrastructure company, I led research and redesign efforts to improve user
        flows for key features, resulting in improved user experience across multiple product categories, from web registrars to 
        self-serve features for free customers. 
        
        I believe that my expertise in design thinking and my passion for creating clear and intuitive user interfaces 
        that guide users seamlessly through their goals would be a valuable asset to the Shippo design team.
        </p>
        
        <p>I'm very impressed by the customer feedback on how quick and easy Shippo is to use, especially for complex tasks like
        international shipping. This goes to show how much thought and effort goes into the user-experience design and product
        at Shippo. I'm very excited for the opportunity of working with the Shippo design team as it feels like user-first
        design is a core value of the company.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <h3 class="signature-cover">Eric Tsai</h3>
