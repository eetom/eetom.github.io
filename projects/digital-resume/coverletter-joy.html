        <p>To: Joy team<br>
        Re: Product designer @ Joy</p>
        <p>Hello! My name is Eric Tsai, a product designer with 10+ years of experience creating user-centric designs
        that elevate user experience while balancing with business goals. I'm particularly interested in Joy's focus on creating 
        a platform to support and empower people to celebrate their special occasions with a seamless user journey. I find 
        the idea of designing for a joyous and emotional experience to be very inspiring. User-centric design that feels invisible 
        and effortless is a passion of mine, and I believe Joy's values of opening design to the entire team truly resonates with me.</p>

        <p>
        In my previous role at Cloudflare, a leading cloud-infrastructure company, I led research and redesign efforts to improve user
        flows for key features, resulting in improved user experience across multiple product categories, from web registrars to 
        self-serve features for free customers. My expertise in design thinking and my passion for creating clear and intuitive user interfaces 
        that guide users seamlessly through their goals would be a valuable asset to the Joy team.
        </p>
        
        <p>I'm very impressed by the way the team works together, I've always felt that design is not created in isolation and that everyone's voices
          are important. The pods concept and the workplace culture really speaks to how the team at Joy shows this value by example.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <h3 class="signature-cover">Eric Tsai</h3>
