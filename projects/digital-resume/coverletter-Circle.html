          </p>

          <p class="contacts2">
            Hello, I’m Eric!
          </p>
          
          <p class="contacts2">
            I'm particularly interested in Circle’s mission to make the world economically more transparent. I firmly believe that
            design and technology possess transformative potential to impact our society, and we should harness these tools to
            effect meaningful positive change. Coming from a design background, I am passionate about collaborating with talented
            individuals at the intersection of design and technology to create a future where financial and economic choices are
            more accessible to everyone.
            </p>
          <p class="contacts2">
            This is why I am excited about the opportunity to work as a UX designer at Circle. I want to contribute to
            innovating a product that is driving change in the dynamic landscape of digital finance.
          </p>
          <p class="contacts2">
            With over 10+ years of experience, I have worked on numerous websites spanning insurtech to security. Here are some key
            skills I bring:
          </p>

          <p class="contacts2">
          <ul>
            <li class="cover-list"><b>Collaboration & Communication:</b> I work well in fast-paced environments, effectively collaborating with product, engineering, and stakeholders to manage
            feedback and lead initiatives independently.</li>
            <li class="cover-list"><b>User Research & Prototyping:</b> I conduct thorough user research (personas, journeys) to understand user needs and translate them into high-fidelity,
            interactive prototypes.</li>
            <li class="cover-list"><b>Design Systems Expertise:</b> I am adept at utilizing and extending design systems like CF-ui and AWS Polaris to maintain design consistency. Even created
            one at Ledger Investing from scratch.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="contacts2 cover-gap">
            My portfolio at <a href="eetom.github.io/portfolio/portfolio.html">eetom.github.io/portfolio/portfolio.html</a> (Password: mischief managed) showcases my skills and experiences. 
            I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to design @ Circle!
          </p>
          <p class="contacts3">Thank you for your time and consideration.<br>
          Sincerely,</p>
