        Re: Senior product designer @ Coinbase</p>
        
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Eric Tsai, a product designer with 10+ years of experience creating designs that enriches user
          experience while balancing with company business goals.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I'm particularly interested in Coinbases‚Äô mission to make the world economically more free. I believe that design and
          technology have the ability to change and shape the world we live in, we should find ways to apply it in ways that can
          make a real impact. I have a passion for technology but come from an design background and so I want to collaborate and
          work with smart people in the intersection of both to create a future with more financial and economic choices for all
          people.
        </p>

        <p>
          At Ledger Investing (insurtech ILS leader), I identified a need for a more efficient customer data system. Manual
          spreadsheets hampered sales. I spearheaded research & design of a centralized admin portal, collaborating with the PM to
          define functionalities. Utilizing user research & information architecture, I designed a platform enabling CRUD, program
          management, and cross-team access, boosting efficiency & reducing errors. It also facilitated internal testing of new
          features, streamlining development.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe my experience in designing clear and efficient user journeys, along with my passion for user-centric design,
          would be a valuable asset to the Coinbase team. I'm particularly interested in how user experience design can further
          enhance the onboarding process for those new to cryptocurrency and Web3.
        </p>

        <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
