           Re: Designer 2 (Job number: 1698906)</p>

        <p>
          Hello! My name is Eric Tsai, a product designer with 10+ years of experience creating designs that
          enriches user experience while balancing with company business goals.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Microsoft web experience collectives' mission to build a web that works for everyone deeply resonates with me. I am
          a big believer of an open web that is inclusive and easy to use as a vital part of our daily lives. I have a passion for
          technology but come from an design background and so I want to collaborate and work with smart people in the
          intersection of both to create not only good software, but software that does good in our world.
        </p>

        <p>
          At Cloudflare, a leading cloud infrastructure company, I led research and redesign initiatives to enhance user flows for
          critical security and data features, benefiting thousands of users. These efforts resulted in a more intuitive and
          efficient experience across various product categories, from firewalls to self-serve data analysis tools. By
          prioritizing usability, I contributed to making Cloudflare's security solutions more accessible to a broader audience,
          ultimately contributing to a safer and more secure web for everyone.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I'm enthused about crafting user experiences that are clear and efficient, eliminating confusion and frustration. My
          proven ability to design intuitive user journeys, fueled by a user-centric approach, would make me a valuable asset to
          the Microsoft WXC team. I'm particularly interested in contributing to products like Search and Browse, which have a
          significant impact on the core Microsoft experience for millions of users.
        </p>
        <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon!<br>
          Sincerely,</p>
