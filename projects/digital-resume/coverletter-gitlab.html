        Re: Sr. Product designer, AI</p>

        <p>
        Hello! My name is Eric Tsai, a product designer with 10+ years of experience creating designs
        that enriches user experience while balancing with company business goals.
        </p>

        <p>
        I'm particularly interested in this role because of the cross-over of AI and DevOps is such an unique and challenging space. I believe AI's potential in software development remains largely untapped. Currently, we focus on issuing commands
        rather than building the context for AI to identify solutions. I have a passion for technology but come from an design background and so I want to collaborate and work with smart people in the intersection of both create future solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
        In my previous role at Amazon AWS, I worked on the AWS Developer tools team working across multiple products to support
        developers and DevOps. In particular the CodeStar Connections project I designed for contributed to the launch 
        of one of AWS early AI products AWS CodeGuru and involved getting third-party code repos such as Bitbucket and Gitlab to 
        establish connections with AWS products.
        
        I believe that my expertise in design thinking and my passion for creating clear and intuitive user interfaces 
        that guide users logically through their goals would be a valuable asset to the Gitlab design team.
        </p>
        
        <p>I'm very impressed after reading through the Product design handbook, it's very through and clear about how the designers on the product design team operate and expected responsibilities each
          designer. I'm very excited for the opportunity of working with the Gitlab design team as it feels like you are truely empowered for design ownership. Also Pajamas is a great name for the design library!</p>

        <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
