          <p class="contacts2">Dear Ms. Eikenberry,</p>
          <p class="contacts2">
            Identity. It's both the key to access and the ultimate security challenge. This fascinating duality is what drew me to
            the Microsoft Security Entra Identity and Access team. As a designer, my goal is to help design the most intuitive
            interfaces that make even complex systems feel effortless for users but help keep the malicious actors out.
          </p>
          
          <p class="contacts2">
            The team's mission to make the web a safer place for everyone is one has always fascinated me. Strong security protects 
            our data and identity, but oftentimes adoption lags. I am a big believer that UX is the key to unlocking wider acceptance
            and I'm eager to help build it.
          </p>
          
          <p class="contacts2">
            I come from 10+ years of experience in startups and larger companies honed my ability to adapt and collaborate. At Cloudflare, 
            I led research and redesign of critical security and data features, improving user experience for thousands. This made
            Cloudflare's security solutions more accessible, contributing to a safer web.
          </p>
          
          <p class="contacts2">
            Thank you for your time and consideration. My work experience, coupled with my desire to build not only good products
            but products that do good, would make me a good fit for the team.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="contacts2">Sincerely,</p>
