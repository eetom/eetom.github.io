          <p class="contacts2">Hello Ms. Fernandez,</p>
          <p class="contacts2">
            The financial system shouldn't be an exclusive club. Everyone
            deserves the opportunity to manage their finances confidently, regardless of background or experience. This is why I'm
            excited for the opportunity to leverage design and technology to break down those barriers.
          </p>
          
          <p class="contacts2">
          Throughout my career, I've thrived in collaborative environments, working closely with product and engineering teams to identify user pain
          points and translate those insights into intuitive solutions. A prime example is my work at Cloudflare, where I led the
          end-to-end design of features that significantly simplified complex firewall workflows, resulting in positive user
          feedback.
          </p>
          
          <p class="contacts2">
          In my previous companies, I've excelled at:
          <ul>
            <li class="cover-list"><b>Design with research:</b> I use user research to identify pain points and inform design decisions. This resulted in features that
            simplified complex workflows based on both data and user heuristics.</li>
            <li class="cover-list"><b>Rapid Prototyping:</b> I'm experienced in creating high-fidelity mockups and low-fidelity prototypes, ensuring efficient iteration and validation.</li>
            <li class="cover-list"><b>Design Systems:</b> Adept at utilizing and extending design systems like CF-ui and AWS Polaris to maintain design consistency.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="contacts2 cover-gap">
          I'm confident my skills and experience in creating status quo changing designs aligns with Robinhood's
          mission of democratizing finance and am looking forward to contributing to the Robinhood Brokerage team to impact the future of digital finance.
          </p>
          <p class="contacts2">Thank you for your time and consideration.<br>
          Sincerely,</p>
          <h3 class="signature-cover">Eric Tsai</h3>
