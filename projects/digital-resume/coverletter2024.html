        <p>To: SafeBase Product team,</p>
        <p>Re: Senior Product Designer <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/safebase/jobs/4406238005">Role #4406238005</a></p>
        <p>June 18th, 2024</p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Building and communicating trust between companies online shouldn't feel like cracking the Enigma code. My mission as a
        product designer is to craft clear, accessible interfaces that turn complex security processes into seamless
        experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
        With over 10 years of experience, I design intuitive and cutting-edge interfaces while leading multiple initiatives to
        launch on schedule. My passion for web security has driven my career at Cloudflare and AWS, where I enhanced web
        security and developer experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
        At Ledger Investing, I designed and maintained the design system "Signature UI," reducing post-launch tickets by 25%. I
        often work closely with product and engineering teams from conception to launch to ensure an efficient product cycle.
        </p>

        <p>
        One of my proudest moments was presenting a talk at San Francisco Design Week on designing for security. The key
        takeaway was the importance of making security accessible and user-friendly to enhance adoption and ultimately make the
        internet safer.
        </p>

        <p>
        I'm drawn to SafeBase for your commitment to prioritizing trust and safety online. Iâ€™m excited about the opportunity to
        join your team and contribute my experience in developing design systems, conducting user research, and collaborating
        with cross-functional teams.
        </p>

        <p>
        My <a href="bit.ly/erictsai-portfolio">portfolio</a> showcases a variety of design projects that demonstrate my skills and experience. I hope we can connect and discuss more
        about how I could contribute to design at SafeBase!
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Thank you for your time and consideration.<br>
        Sincerely,
        </p>
        <br>
