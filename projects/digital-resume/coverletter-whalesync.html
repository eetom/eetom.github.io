        Re: Product designer 2 (Job number: 1696763)</p>

      <p>
        Identity. It's both the key to access and the ultimate security challenge. This fascinating duality is what drew me to
        the Microsoft Security Entra Identity and Access team. As a designer, my goal is to help design the most intuitive
        interfaces that make even complex systems feel effortless for users but help keep the bad actors out.
      </p>

      <p>
        The team‚Äôs mission to make the web a safer place for everyone is one has always fascinated me. In today's digital world,
        strong security is essential to protecting our information. As a designer with a solid background, I believe user
        experience (UX) is key to making security solutions more widely adopted. I'm eager to collaborate with the talented
        people at Microsoft Security to create innovative security software that not only protects users but also makes the web a
        safer and more secure experience for everyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        10+ years of experience in startups and larger companies honed my ability to adapt and collaborate. At Cloudflare, I led
        research and redesign of critical security and data features, improving user experience for thousands. This made
        Cloudflare's security solutions more accessible, contributing to a safer web.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thank you for your time and consideration. My work experience, coupled with my desire to build not only good products
        but products that do good, would make me a good fit for the product designer position on the team.
      </p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
