      <p>To: Hiring @ Microsoft Security design team<br>
        Re: Senior Product designer (Job number: 1699361)</p>

      <p>
        Hello! My name is Eric Tsai, a product designer with 10+ years of experience creating designs that
        enriches user experience while balancing with company business goals.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Microsoft Security's mission to make the web a safer place for everyone deeply resonates with me. I've
        always been
        fascinated by designing for security and its potential to safeguard information in today's digital world. As
        someone
        with a strong design background, I believe UX plays a critical role in security adoption. I'm eager to
        collaborate with
        the talented teams at Microsoft Security to create innovative security software that not only protects users but
        also
        makes the web a safer and more secure experience for everyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        At Cloudflare, a leading cloud infrastructure company, I led research and redesign initiatives to enhance user
        flows for
        critical security and data features, benefiting thousands of users. These efforts resulted in a more intuitive
        and
        efficient experience across various product categories, from firewalls to self-serve data analysis tools. By
        prioritizing usability, I contributed to making Cloudflare's security solutions more accessible to a broader
        audience,
        ultimately contributing to a safer and more secure web for everyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm fascinated about designing clear and efficient user experiences that is clear and easy to use. My track
        record of
        crafting intuitive user journeys, driven by a user-centric approach, makes me a strong candidate for the
        Microsoft
        Security design team. I'm particularly interested in the challenge of building security products that are
        lightweight
        and unobtrusive. Imagine, prioritizing a seamless user experience while still providing robust protection -
        that's the
        kind of innovation I would want to help build!
      </p>
      <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon!<br>
        Sincerely,</p>
