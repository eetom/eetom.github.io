          <p class="contacts2">Hey Wyze team,</p>
          <p class="contacts2">
            As a home owner that has set up many smart home products I still remember the first time I set up a Wyze camera
            and remember thinking “Wow, that was easy!” and my home has been since filled with Wyze cameras and lights.
          </p>
          
          <p class="contacts2">
            With over 10 years of experience, my design process focuses on researching user pain-points and working with the product and engineering teams.
            My end-to-end ownership of features at Cloudflare resulted in products that simplified complex firewall workflows and
            received strong positive user feedback.
          </p>
          
          <p class="contacts2">
          <ul>
            <li class="cover-list"><b>Collaboration & Communication:</b> I work well in fast-paced environments, effectively collaborating with product, engineering, and stakeholders to manage
            feedback and lead initiatives independently.</li>
            <li class="cover-list"><b>User Research & Prototyping:</b> I conduct thorough user research (personas, journeys) to understand user needs and translate them into high-fidelity,
            interactive prototypes.</li>
            <li class="cover-list"><b>Design Systems Expertise:</b> I am adept at utilizing and extending design systems like CF-ui and AWS Polaris to maintain design consistency. Even created
            one at Ledger Investing from scratch.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="contacts2 cover-gap">
            Let's forget about clunky technology of '00s, Wyze's future of smart homes is where it's at - simple, useful tech for everyone. This is
            the team I want to work for.
          </p>
          <p class="contacts2">Thank you for your time and consideration.<br>
          Sincerely,</p>
