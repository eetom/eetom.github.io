                    <h3>Step 1: Use formal Critique sessions to get people familiar with critique process</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li>The session should comprise of between 5-6 people and from all different backgrounds (get Support, Sales, Engineers, managers involved!)</li>
                    <li>Do this weekly, get people into the habit of talking about their designs</li>
                    </ul>
                    <hr class="writing-rule">
                    <h3>Step 2: Follow a Critique Guideline</h3>
                    <p>Here is a quick guideline about how to run a critique session.</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Start off the session by going over the session guidelines (see set the stage for each feedback session).</li>
                    <li>Encourage feedback from everyone</li>
                    <li>All feedback should be backed up with reasoning</li>
                    <li>Tie all the feedback to the goal of the design</li>
                    <li>Affirm what works, its easy to be too focused on what can be improved and what is already working could be missed and inadvertently changed.</li>
                    <li>Identify problems first, then solutions.</li>
                    <li>Suggestions not mandates, allow the designer to explore the solutions.</li>
                    </ul>
          
                    <hr class="writing-rule">
          
                    <h3>Step 3: Set the Stage for each feedback session</h3>
                    <p>
                      Here's how to start your critique sessions
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Review the goals of the design (Business, Customer, Product, etc)
                          <p class="code">example: The design is to let people know about our upcoming event, it'll be used as a banner on a social media page, its goal is to drive people towards our event page and get them to get tickets.</p></li>
                    <li>Review the constraints set by the project
                          <p class="code">example: This has to be viewed on web both desktop and mobile, it has to be responsive and within the size constraints of 800px by 200px</p></li>
                    <li>Review the timeline/schedule for the project
                          <p class="code">example: the expected time to complete the design is 1 week, and have it developed production ready in 1 week.</p></li>
                    <li>Check for agreement on all the above topics
                          <p class="code">example: does this make sense? do we all agree on this?</p></li>
                    <li>Set expectations of the fidelity of the design
                          <p class="code">example: What i'm showing today are some lo-fi mockups of different designs concepts we're currently working with</p></li>
                    <li>Direct the feedback to where you need it
                          <p class="code">example: Please let me know which of the concepts you like the most, or if there any other concepts we could try exploring</p></li>
                    </ul>
          
                    <hr class="writing-rule">
          
                    <h3>Step 4: Learn how to share your designs for feedback</h3>
                    <p>For interaction design/product design, heres how to share your designs
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Start by simulating a customer experience
                         <p class="code">example: This is a customer signing up for our pro plan, they will use our new on-boarding screen and fill out our new account forms....etc</p></li>
                    <li>Pick a task and run through from start to finish
                         <p class="code">example: This is Karen, she's a blogger who is looking to update the security on her Wordpress site ....etc</p></li>
                    <li>You can start even earlier to give even more context and background
                         <p class="code">example: She's tried many other of our competitors before but a lot of their sign ups/plans require her to pay for a year up front and this is very frustrating for her. She just wants to try the product to see if it fits her needs ... etc.</p></li>
                    <li>Fake it with interactions (animations)
                         <p class="code">example: Animate on the screen the full interactions, ding! zip! and smiley face pops up. And then you're done! There is a message that assures you that your account has been process and will be ready to use in the next hour.</p></li>
                    <li>Ask people to write down feedback and leave it until the end.</li>
                    </ul>
          
                    <hr class="writing-rule">
          
                    <h3>And Finally: How to give feedback and discussion about design</h3>
          
                    <ul>
                    <li>Have something to spark the discussion, maybe paper print outs (let ppl draw, note, cut up etc)</li>
                    <li>Get them involved in the discussion, hang back and do more observation</li>
                    </ul>
