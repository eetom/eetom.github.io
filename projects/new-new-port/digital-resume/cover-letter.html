        <p class="no-title">Hello, my name is Eric Tsai.</p>

        <p class="no-title">I am excited to be applying for the Product Designer role at Asana, I’ve been chatting about the position with my friend Philina Fan (we worked at Cloudflare together) and have reviewed the job description and feel that I would be a great candidate for the role.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="no-title">I’m a designer with 6 years experience working in design, working on projects ranging from websites to native apps. Over the years I have developed strong design fundamentals, coding experience, and understanding of the end-to-end product process. My goal is to join a company where I would be able to continue to grow as a designer, ship great product, and to contribute to the design community.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="no-title">I’ve included my resume that covers my previous work experiences and results. Please contact me at <a href="tel:+14157129912">415-712-9912</a> or via email me at <a href="erictsaidesign@gmail.com">erictsaidesign@gmail.com</a> for any questions. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
        </p>
