          Industry database is a on-going project for Ledger Investing that was created to give customers and potential customers some industry

        <h3 id="part-1" class="work-title mt5">01. Problem</h3>
            <p class="work-content">
              This project primarily started from many different teams having different challenges. The sales team was relying on using the "old database"
              as a means to show potential customers some of the cool data analysis our team was working on, they needed something more accessible and updated to 
              show where Ledger was moving towards. The data science team has been working on researching and writing a number of different topics, but didn't have
              a space where they can share with the actuaries on the customers side, they often had to create custom PDFs and spend a lot of time answering basic
              questions. <br><br> 
              Finally, I felt that overall Ledger was very much a "black box" to a lot of people and even some customers, having some documentation and
              resouces would be able to help both active customers and potential customers get to know Ledger better.
            </p>

        <h3 id="part-2" class="work-title">02. Old database</h3>
            <p class="work-content">
              The old database was something the founding team had created to be the original platform. It leveraged publicly available data on various insurance
              companies' financial reports to build a foundational resource for investors.
            </p>
            <p class="work-content">
              Other than the industry data, the team also put their research and methdology in writing to better explain the process and science that 
              was behind how the data was analyzed.
            </p>
            <p class="work-content">
              Separate from the old database, the Data Science team worked putting together their writing online in the form of a "wiki". <br><br>
              <i>Note: it's not really a wiki, as it's not updatable by difffernt publishers.</i>
            </p>

        <h3 id="part-3" class="work-title">03. Design</h3>
            <p class="work-content">
              So the goal we started out with was to take all this different pieces of content and resources and put them together on the website.
            </p>
            <p class="work-content">
              Some considerations we experimented with was different views for visitors who did not have platform access and the customers who did have platform access.
              This woul 'gate' some of the more private data and resources.
            </p>
            <p class="work-content">
              The main sections we worked on were<br><br>
              1. A industry database of insurance companies by their lines of business with the most up-to-date data <br>
              2. A library for the research, writing, and explainations behind the data science<br>
              3. Eventually buidling out resources for the platform (help guides, troubleshooting, and explaining new features.)
            </p>
            <p class="work-content">
              There were some sections we started designing but probably for a future version such as having a section for media and presenatations. When I chatted with the
              Sales teams, they and the executives often did presentations at events. It would have been great for people who were at the event to be able to get the 
              recorded presentation and even download the slides.
            </p>

        <h3 id="part-4" class="work-title">04. Hackathon</h3>
            <p class="work-content">
              Our team rallied behind this idea as a project to work together in person. The product, engineering, and data teams met up in California to have a "hackathon" to see
              the fastest MVP we could build from the industry database project.
            </p>
            <p class="work-content">
              Our time frame was 3 days to refine the design, the messaging, connect the old database data stores and publish all the components from the front-end. It was a great
              time working in person with all the team 
            </p>
