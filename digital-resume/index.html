          <p class="hidden">I've always had some industries that I wanted to expand my experience in, and one of them was the
            intersection of technology and finance. It's the type of work that encompasses many key challanges for design,
            such as data visulization, working with complex transactional processes, and a wide set or stakeholders and customer
            types to design for. My time on the team has led to many initiatives including upgrading the public facing website and
            content,
            various user flows from sign in and account management, to data onboarding and management. I've also been playing a
            role in advancing design as a dicpline within the team to encourage cross-team collaboration, from working on the
            company blog and marketing,
            to working with data scientists publishing their core work, and helping out with our offsite team swag.
