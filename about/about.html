          <h3>ðŸ‘‹ Oh hey, I'm Eric!</h3>
          <p>I'm a designer with a passion for bringing ideas to life. Originally from Taiwan, I grew up in Canada and now I 
            call the PNW (Seattle, WA) my home!
          </p>

          <p>I'm constantly coming up with new ways to reinvent stuff or old techniques for the new. Lately, my learning flame has
          been burning bright with cooking, baking, woodworking, darkroom chemistry (it's like science/magic all-in-one!), coding, and even
          building circuits.

          <h3>ðŸŽ¨ I am a product designer</h3>
          <p>
            It all started at a young age, around 8, when I really into coloring and working on art projects. I'd spend hours crafting epic covers
            for school projects and obsessing over color palettes. Fast forward to college, where I went deeper into the world of design
            for the digital age, learning about print publication, architecture, and web design at SFU in Vancouver Canada. 
            There, I met a whole bunch of like-minded creatives, and together we embarked on some wild startup adventures across North America!
          </p>

          <p>
            For the past 10+ years, I've been leading design on teams building user-centered products. I design by working closely
            across product and engineering, translating user needs into impactful features, and building design systems for
            efficiency and consistency.
          </p>
          <p>
            Previously, I designed at Ledger Investing. I focused on working with the Product team to lead the design and
            development of our online platforms and resources for our customers. My role involves working with Product managers to
            assess and spec out designs from our teamâ€™s roadmap and then reviewing and handing off the designs with our engineering
            team.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to that, I was a UX designer working at Amazon AWS
            for the Developer tools team. I supported multiple engineering teams, improving features like CodePipeline and CodeStar.
            I conducted user research, partnered with product managers, and ensured smooth design handoffs.
            At Cloudflare, as the first UX hire, I streamlined UI components and established their first design system. Working
            across web security, analytics, and data products, I fostered a global design presence and actively engaged the design
            community.
          </p>
          <p class="mb5">
            Right now, Iâ€™m looking to grow along a team that is also
            growing and pushing the boundaries of what impact design can
            have on our world today. My design goal is to help bridge the divide between design and other teams. Whether itâ€™s
            building tools, systems, or process, even if the individual impact is small, at scale it can drive a real meaningful
            change.
