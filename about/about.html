          <h3>ðŸ‘‹ Oh hey, I'm Eric!</h3>
          <p>I'm a designer with a passion for bringing ideas to life. Originally from Taiwan, I grew up in Canada and now I 
            call the PNW (Seattle, WA) my home!
          </p>

          <p>I'm constantly coming up with new ways to reinvent stuff or old techniques for the new. Lately, my learning flame has
          been burning bright with cooking, baking, woodworking, darkroom chemistry (it's like science/magic all-in-one!), coding, and even
          building circuits.
          </p>

          <h3>ðŸŽ¨ I am a product designer</h3>
          <p>
            It all started at a young age, around 8, when I really got into coloring and working on art projects. I'd spend hours
            crafting epic covers for school projects and obsessing over color palettes. Fast forward to college, where I went deeper
            into the world of design for the digital age, learning about print publication, architecture, and web design at SFU in
            Vancouver, Canada. There, I met a whole bunch of like-minded creatives, and together we embarked on some wild startup
            adventures across North America!
          </p>

          <p>
            For the past 10+ years, I've been leading design teams building user-centered products. I design by working closely with
            product and engineering teams, translating user needs into impactful features, and building design systems for
            efficiency and consistency.
          </p>
          <p>
            Previously, at Ledger Investing, I led the design and development of online platforms and resources, working closely with product
            managers and the engineering team to execute our roadmap.
          <p>
            Prior to that, I was a UX designer working at Amazon AWS
            for the Developer tools team. I improved features for CodePipeline and CodeStar, conducted user research, and ensured smooth design handoffs.

            Before that I worked at Cloudflare, as the first UX hire. I streamlined UI components, established their first design system, and fostered a
            global design presence across 3 international offices.
          </p>
          <p class="mb5">
            Currently, Iâ€™m looking to join a team that pushes the boundaries of design's impact. My goal is to bridge the gap
            between design and other teams. By building tools, systems, and processes, even small individual impacts can lead to
            meaningful change at scale.
          </p>
