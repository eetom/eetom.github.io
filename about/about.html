          <h3>ðŸ‘‹ Oh hey, I'm Eric!</h3>
          <p>Nice to meet you. I'm a Taiwan born - Canadian raised living in beautiful pacific northwest. I spend most of my time
            designing, photographing, and writing when I'm not exploring the local food and nature.
          </p>

          <p>I like to think of myself as a creator, I'm into honing the creative process and making things for the sake of making things. 
            I'll find new ways to make old things, or old ways to make new things. Lately things that I've been learning about are cooking, 
            baking, woodwork, darkroom chemicals, home automation, javascript, pcb soldering.. the list goes on.
          </p>

          <img class="blog-img mt4" src="../img/hosted/me4.png">
          <p class="caption mb4">Where to find me? Probably at the local Boudering gym or taking photos on a sunny day.</p>

          <h3>ðŸŽ¨ Professionally I am a designer</h3>
          
          <p>From the early age of 8 I knew I wanted to design and create. Long story, but I really liked working with colors
            and would spend hours putting together project covers and setting up color themes. Fast forward to universtiy, I majored in design
            intersecting with technology and the digital world. Met a lot of like minded friends that kicked-off a long wild ride criss-crossing
             North America.
          </p>

          <p>Over the years, I've been a part of numerous start-ups journeys. Some as small as 3 people crammed in a old MontrÃ©al apartment
            hacking into the night before a midnight poutine break. Some so large that we had to book out 4 hotels in Napa to fit all of us in 
            for the company off-site. The thing is I love being able to create together, collaborate and build something that a single person
            alone would not be possible.</p>
