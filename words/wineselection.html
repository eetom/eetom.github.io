          <p>Over the winter holiday break, I had a few chances to go for some nice dinners in fancy settings. It bothered me that I
          had really no idea how to pick out wines so I decided to do some research and create this entry. All I knew at that time
          was that generally speaking white wines pair with lighter foods and red wines with red meats? Not untrue, but here is a
          bit more information on how the main varieties of wines match different situations.

            <tr>
              <td>Pinot gris / Pino grigio</td>
              <td>Grigio = Italian style, Gris = French style. French is more full taste. Italian style is more lighter and dry.

              <td>Chardonnay</td>
              <td>Full body (strong wine taste) most popular veriety in the world. Aged in barrels = deeper wine taste. Somewhat
                buttery taste.</td>

            <tr>
              <td>Riesling / Gewürztraminer / Moscato</td>
              <td>These are generally the sweeter wines, light and refreshing. Lower alcohol (&lt;13%) = more dryness.</td>
              <td>Sweeter varieties pair with dessert or on its own. Drier wines will match with asian foods, pork ,and chicken.

              <td>Pinot noir</td>

                you usually pair with white wines. Earthy.</td>

            <tr>
              <td>Cabernet sauvignon</td>

            <tr>
              <td>Shiraz / Syrah</td>
              <td>Similar to cabernet sauvignon. Hearty & spicy taste.</td>

            <tr>
              <td>Zinfandel / Primitivo</td>

          <h3>To sum up a few things:</h3>
          <p> I personally like lighter sweeter wines, but this doesn't always match the food. By doing a bit of research it's nice
            to know which red wine would be lighter and sweeter and subtle difference between the white wines. Even the more
            darker full body tasting wines have their place (was amazing with French food, so buttery) and shouldn't be avoided.
            The process to pick out wines is still a very personal choice, and it'll take time and effort to find what suits your
            preferences. Cheers!
