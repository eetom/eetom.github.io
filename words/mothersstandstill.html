            Hey, do you remember that stranger that you met the day you were born? The one that you lived with, struggled with,
            laughed with, and eventually grow apart? It's funny how they were so much a part of your life. Over time you get to know them
            (or not) and you come to see that they were also like you and had dreams. Then one day, you appeared in their life.
            They made a decision to give you as much as they could. They put in the hours, figurative sweat and tears, with the hope that someday
            you would get to decide who you are and what you want to do. We live our lives, move forward and take in all life has to offer.
            But if you'd look back, you'd see that person, the one you grew up with, and see that they had been there the whole time.
            Maybe not always the way we wanted, but they did what they could.
          </p>

            I know that everyone has a different childhood, some closer with their parents, some even without them. I can't say I've 
            always got along with my parents, but I know they wanted good things for me. Thank you for all the good and bad times.
            They've made me who I am today. I think about someday when I become a parent, what dreams will my child have, and how far ahead beyond 
            they will go.
          </p>
