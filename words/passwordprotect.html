          <h3>Calm down and learn about ambient technology</h3>
          <p>
            There was a recent article I was reading which in the comments someone had brought up a comparison to the tenents of "Calm Tech". I found it an interesting collection of thoughts,
            and wanted to take some short notes on these observations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Calm Technology™/Calm Computing is a term coined by PARC Researchers Mark Weiser and John Seely Brown as they noticed that technology was getting more complex and harder to use.

              <td>Technology should require the smallest possible amount of attention</td>
              <td>Ambient or background technology that doesn't pull you away from what you are primarily focused on. </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>2</td>
              <td>Technology should inform and create calm</td>
              <td>Limiting technology exposure as a means to human needs rather than for the sake of technology.</td>

            <tr>
              <td>3</td>
              <td>Technology should make use of the periphery</td>
              <td>Periphery meaning outside the locus of our attention. Something that doesn't require our full attention/focus.</td>

              <td>Technology can communicate, but doesn't need to speak</td>

              <td>6</td>

            <tr>
              <td>7</td>
              <td>The right amount of technology is the minimum needed to solve the problem</td>
              <td>Here is another minimalist approach to technology, and that technology should get out of the way when not needed or only do what is required.</td>

            <tr>
              <td>8</td>
              <td>Technology should respect social norms</td>
              <td>Technology does over time "train"/educate the users. Just as we have adapted to how mobile interfaces and touch screens, whatever new technology that
                we come up with next should be aware of how much human behavior we are "overwriting".

          <h3>Flex your Calm</h3>

          <p>
            My favorite part of the website are a set of <a href="https://calmtech.com/exercises">thinking exercises</a> to explore ideas in Calm Tech. The topics explored are
            based on everyday modren technologies such as fridges and alarm clocks, but ask the question "Can this be imporved?". Can we think of ways that these machines communicate
            more discreetly without adding to the noise of all our daily notifications and alerts?
          </p>

          <ul class="mb5">
            <li>What could be an alarm clock that wakes you up in the calmest way possible?</li>
            <li>What could a battery that would let you know when it was wearing out be like?</li>
            <li>What types of notifications could we create that would blend into our home environments?</li>
            <li>Etc etc ..</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Some of the key questions they wanted you to focus on while exploring..</p>

          <ul class="mb5">
            <li>How does the device catch your attention?</li>
            <li>How does the device interact with the you?</li>
            <li>What kind of information does the object provide?</li>
            <li>Etc etc ..</li>
          </ul>

          <hr class="mb5 mt4 ml0 small-line" />

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>

          <p>
            I really liked the focus on the user as a person with a life outside of the confines of technology. Calm tech is a reminder for us to think about who the user is outside of the user technology experience.
            What were they doing before using the tech? What will they do afterwards? What other thoughts and goals they might have while using the software? These are questions that I feel can be added to a further
            exploration when building / working with technology. My personal takeaway here is I need to be more considerate on users rather than assuming they are forced to use the software that I've designing. There
            could be a hundred things everyday fighting for their attention, a bit of calm tech thinking can go a long way in happier people working with technology.
          </p>
