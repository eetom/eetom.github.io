            There is a story about a person who was struck by a stray arrow. They felt immediate pain from the iron tip piercing
            their flesh. Still in the moment of pain, their mind began to run wild with thoughts: "Will they have to amputate this
            leg if I don't get it treated in time?" and "What if this leaves a scar for the remainder of my life?" Many thoughts
            slowly flooded through the person's mind, all of which focused on the negative and frustrating side of things. The
            storyteller refers to this as "the second arrow"; a metaphysical arrow that caused emotional suffering in that person.

                .. The first arrow signifies unavoidable pain that comes with existence, while the second arrow represents the suffering we
                add through our thoughts and fears ..

          <p>
            My own interpretation of this is that even though I do belive that we all suffer from a lot of "second arrow" pain, we
            can't all just be pure stoics in life. I think being aware that in this metaphoric story, even though someone else fired
            that arrow at us, it is ourselves that shoots the second arrow at ourselves. We don't have control over many things in
            life, both the good and the bad. However, we do have the ability to control or acknowledge that which we do have control
            over. Hopefully understanding this will greatly reduce uneccessary suffering in our lives.
