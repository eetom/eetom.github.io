          <h3>Step 1: Use formal Critique sessions to get people familiar with critique process</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The session should comprise of between 5-6 people and from all different backgrounds (get Support, Sales, Engineers,
            managers involved!)</li>
            <li>Do this weekly, get people into the habit of talking about their designs</li> 
          </ul>

          <hr class="mb5 mt5 ml0 small-line" />

          <h3>Step 2: Follow a Critique Guideline</h3>
          <p>Here is a quick guideline about how to run a critique session.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Start off the session by going over the session guidelines (see set the stage for each feedback session).</li>
            <li>Encourage feedback from everyone</li>
            <li>All feedback should be backed up with reasoning</li>
            <li>Tie all the feedback to the goal of the design</li>
            <li>Affirm what works, its easy to be too focused on what can be improved and what is already working could be missed and
            inadvertently changed.</li>
            <li>Identify problems first, then solutions.</li>
            <li>Suggestions not mandates, allow the designer to explore the solutions.</li>
          </ul>

          <hr class="mb5 mt5 ml0 small-line" />

          <h3>Step 3: Set the Stage for each feedback session</h3>
          <p>Here's how to start your critique sessions</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Review the goals of the design (Business, Customer, Product, etc)</li>
            <p class="code">
              example: The design is to let people know about our upcoming event, it'll be used as a banner on a social media page,
              its goal is to drive people towards our event page and get them to get tickets.
            </p>
            <li>Review the constraints set by the project</li>
            <p class="code">
              example: This has to be viewed on web both desktop and mobile, it has to be responsive and within the size constraints
              of 800px by 200px
            </p>
            <li>Review the timeline/schedule for the project</li>
            <p class="code">
              example: the expected time to complete the design is 1 week, and have it developed production ready in 1 week.
            </p>
            <li>Check for agreement on all the above topics</li>
            <p class="code">
              example: does this make sense? do we all agree on this?
            </p>
            <li>Set expectations of the fidelity of the design</li>
            <p class="code">
              example: What i'm showing today are some lo-fi mockups of different designs concepts we're currently working with
            </p>
            <li>Direct the feedback to where you need it</li>
            <p class="code">
              example: Please let me know which of the concepts you like the most, or if there any other concepts we could try
              exploring
            </p>
          </ul>

          <hr class="mb5 mt5 ml0 small-line" />

          <h3>Step 4: Learn how to share your designs for feedback</h3>
          <p>For interaction design/product design, heres how to share your designs</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Start by simulating a customer experience</li>
            <p class="code">
              example: This is a customer signing up for our pro plan, they will use our new on-boarding screen and fill out our new
              account forms....etc
            </p>
            <li>Pick a task and run through from start to finish</li>
            <p class="code">
              example: This is Lisa, she's a blogger who is looking to update the security on her Wordpress site ....etc
            </p>
            <li>You can start even earlier to give even more context and background</li>
            <p class="code">
              example: She's tried many other of our competitors before but a lot of their sign ups/plans require her to pay for a
              year up front and this is very frustrating for her. She just wants to try the product to see if it fits her needs ...
              etc.
            </p>
            <li>Fake it with interactions (animations)</li>
            <p class="code">
              example: Animate on the screen the full interactions, ding! zip! and smiley face pops up. And then you're done! There is
              a message that assures you that your account has been process and will be ready to use in the next hour.
            </p>
            <li>Ask people to write down feedback and leave it until the end.</li>
          </ul>

          <hr class="mb5 mt5 ml0 small-line" />

          <h3>And Finally: How to give feedback and discussion about design</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Have something to spark the discussion, maybe paper print outs (let ppl draw, note, cut up etc)</li>
            <li>Ask people to write down feedback and leave it until the end.</li>
          </ul>
