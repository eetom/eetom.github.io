          <p>You might have heard of someone describing your local espresso coffee place as "Third wave" coffee or have heard to term used before when reading about different brands of coffee roasters, but what does this term mean and where does it come from?</p>
          <p>Similar to the concept of industrial revolutions, the coffee "waves" are when a new era of coffee in the minds of the consumer begins. These were the moment when how accessible or appreciated coffee was for the average consumer changed.</p>

                to Europe, and estabish a firm foothold in the heart of the city in the forms of early coffee shops.

              <td>The first wave was when the idea of consuming coffee went from "novelty to commodity", coffee was being produced at mass produced 
                industrial levels by major distributors such as Folgers and Maxwell House. Popularizing low cost black coffee with cream and sugar and profiting from the producers.</td>

                Consumers were wanting of more choice and quality, espresso drinks with foamy milk became more popular.

              <td>2010s</td>
              <td>The 3rd wave of coffee was from "culture to consumer awareness". People started to care about and want to know more about where their coffeee was from, who roasted it, and who grew it.
                The consumers began to learn about coffee origins, different roast profiles, and even dabble in home coffee setups. The boom of the "specialty" coffee; single origin with experimental wash methodologies.

                A movement from "consumer awareness to connection through coffee". Coffee will become more personalized and less about brands and standardized flavor?
