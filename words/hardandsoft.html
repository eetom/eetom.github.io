            I think we I read these quotes, I'm reminded by how hard the world is. There are constant sturggles and things to overcome. 
            We spend a large part of our lives preparing and engaging in the "hardness" of our lives. At the same time if we were to only
            live hard lives, and not make room for soft gentleness for ourselves and the people around us our lives would be but half lived.

                “You are in danger of living a life so <span class="highlighter">comfortable and soft</span>, that you will die without ever realizing your true

          <p>
            Finding the right balance between being "hard" and "soft" may seem to be contridictory but they may have more in common then at first glance.
            Often, I find my self being very tough, tough on myself, tough on my efforts, in general very tough on a tough world. It has it's benefits
            of pushing me further and keep me from becoming too complacent. But at the same time, I remind myself time and again to be soft and gentle when
            needed. Gentle to myslef, to the people around me, and gentle on a tough world in need of gentleness.

                “If I wasn't <span class="highlighter">hard</span>, I wouldn't be alive.
