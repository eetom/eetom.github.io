          <p>A quick reference note on development times and methodology for Cinestill's CS41 two-bath kit for color C-41 home development. But mostly because I'm tired of looking all this
            information up every time it's been 3 to 4 months since I last developed some color film and need to look up all the temperatures and timings.
          </p>

          <p>The CS41 comes in two varaieties, the powdered form or the liquid form. Both will make 1000ml or 1 quart of developer and develop about 24 color rolls. The main
            difference between the powdered form and the liquid form is that you have to mix them differently to create the 2 baths.
          </p>

          <p>Start by mixing the chemicals to form the two baths.</p>

            <h3>Note on agitation</h3>
            <p>The supposed effects of constant agitation on development results. There isn't any offical consensus on this opinion.<br><br>
              1) <b>Sharpness</b> Continuous agitation suppresses the creation of sharpness-enhancing edge effects.<br><br>
              2) <b>Film speed</b> Continous agitation minimizes development time because the highlights developer quicker than they would
              otherwise. However, this decrease in development time can also result in diminished shadow detail because the shadows
              continue to develop (albeit to a steadily decreasing extend) with longer development times.</p>

          <h3>Development time adjustments for multiple use of DF96</h3>
          <p>An 1000ml (Quart) size container of DF96 can develop up to 16 rolls of film.<br>
          A 500ml (18oz) size container can only develop up to 8 rolls</p>
          <p>The general rule is to add +15 seconds of development time per number of rolls already developed.</p>

          <h3>Note on pushing and pulling film</h3>
          <p>To push or pull film using DF96, adjust the tempurature up or down 5°F (3°C) for every half stop.</p>

          <h3>Additional notes</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>When it turns from yellowish to dark amber, the developer is close to exhaustion.</li>
            <li>Before using used developer, do a snip test. The results on a daylit piece of film should be opaque.</li>
            <li>The shelf life of DF96 is 1 year.</li>
            <li>The opened shelf life of DF96 is 2 months.</li>
            <li>Used Df96 Monobath contains dissolved silver that is harmful to the environment if improperly disposed of. After your
            chemistry has been exhausted, you should contact your local waste management department.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Opinions on DF96</h3>
          <blockquote class="ml0 mt0 pl4 black-90 bl bw2  ">
            <p class="f5 f4-m f3-l lh-copy measure mt0">
              If I were you I'd throw it away, and buy some separate developer, stop and fixer. Speed/complexity gains from monobaths
              are minimal, compared to consistency risks. XTOL, D76, DDX are excellent general purpose developers. Any stop and fixer
              will do.

              A gentleman on RFF tipped me to filter the DF96 before I try to use it again, and then check with a test piece of film
              to see if it is still ok. Using a paper coffee filter, it removed sludge from the solution! Guess that was the emulsion stripped off the Silberra
              film, The dev was now clear again..

              I developed my first two rolls (Tri-X and HP5) in Cinestill D96 and a Lab-Box just this past week. 3 minutes at 80F,
              then rinse for about sixty seconds in fresh water. I got great negatives, and they were more consistent than using D76
              or any other multi-step process. I'll definitely keep using the method.
              
              I took the closed bottle, put it in the sink, covered it with hot water, and when it was 80F, poured it into the
              Lab-Box. Easy Peasy.
