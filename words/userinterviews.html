          <p class="blog-callout">Notes from Ground Rules for Interviewing in <a href="https://www.strategyzer.com/library/value-proposition-design-2">Value proposition design</a> written by Alex Osterwalder, Yves Pigneru, Greg Bernarda, and Alan Smith</p>

          <p>I working on a project right now that is at the stage where we're starting to chat a bit more with potential users. Been going through the <a href="https://www.strategyzer.com/library/value-proposition-design-2">Value proposition design</a>
            book for guidelines and tips on how to better understand the pains of the target user group. Here's a small section on what the book calls "Ground rules for interviewing" or talking to people.
          </p>

          <hr class="mb5 mt4 ml0 small-line" />
          
          <h3>Rule 1: Adopt a beginner's mind</h3>
          <p>
            You may think you know the person or group you are interviewing, but you'll learn much more if you leave all your asumptions at the door. Our biases
            can make us lead the conversation one way or another. We need to have guidelines to keep the topic focused, but allow for unexpected things to pop up and 
            see where it can take you.
          </p>
          <hr class="mb5 mt4 ml0 small-line" />

          <h3>Rule 2: Listen more than you talk</h3>
          <p>
            Pretty straight forward, let to other person open up and have the space to drive the conversation more naturally. You are here to absorb as much information 
            from them as possible.
          </p>
          <hr class="mb5 mt4 ml0 small-line" />

          <h3>Rule 3: Get facts, not opinions</h3>
          <p>
            Some questions are too open ended, and maybe end up in a very opinion type answer. Asking more specifically like asking "When was the last time you ..." or
            "How many times a week do you .." can lead to more specific facts.
          </p>
          <hr class="mb5 mt4 ml0 small-line" />

          <h3>Rule 4: Ask "why" to get real motivations</h3>
          <p>
            Asking a lot of "why?" questions will help you dig deeper past the surface level. 
          </p>
          <hr class="mb5 mt4 ml0 small-line" />

          <h3>Rule 5: The goal of customer insight interviews is not selling/buying in (even if a sales is involved) It's about learning.</h3>
          <p>
            Getting a sale or download etc is a pretty strong validation of your product/solution. But depending on how early on this is, especially if it's
            more of an exploratory interview to figure out product market fit, this is your chance to have a better understanding of their purchasing criteria
            without forcing a decision. Use this opportunity to ask "how do you decide what you use/purchase?"
          </p>
          <hr class="mb5 mt4 ml0 small-line" />

          <h3>Rule 6: Don't mention solutions (i.e., your prototypes value propositions) too early</h3>
          <p>
            If you talk about your product or solutions too early in the conversation, the conversation will quickly revolve around that one solution.
            Before you get too into a single solution, see if the person you're interviewing might have a different take or angle about how they might
            approach the problem. Once this door closes, it's very hard to open back up again without your solution biasing their thinking.
          </p>
          <hr class="mb5 mt4 ml0 small-line" />

          <h3>Rule 7: Follow up & always open doors</h3>
          <p>
            There are 2 questions I like to end the interview with. The first is "Would it be cool if we continued this conversation later again?". A repeat
            interview over a period of time allows you to see the change between the first interview and the 2nd. Maybe even to dig deeper into a particular area
            that you have decided to focus in on, or to clarify something they mentioned in passing on the first round. The second question is "Is there anyone
            else you think we should talk to about this?". It's always good to be building up a pool of people that you can chat with and increase your coverage
            of the target user group.
          </p>
