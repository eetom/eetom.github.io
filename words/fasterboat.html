            Once upon a time, there was a men's eight rowing team in Great Britan that wanted to win the Olympic gold medal for their event.
            They trained really hard and eventually won the gold metal in the Sydney Olympics in 2000.
          </p>
          <p>
            They team was asked later on, what was the secret sauce to their success, where they had not achieve such results in the past?
            What did they change? The team leader reflected that they only changed one thing, they asked themselves only one question 
            on any decision they made as a team and as individuals.
          </p>

          <p>
            The simplicity of this not only made the team highly aligned to the team goal, it made decision making more straight forward.
            Should they train on Thursdays instead of Mondays? Will it make the boat go faster? They would pick the answer that resulted in 
            that one team metric.
