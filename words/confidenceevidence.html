          <p>If found this quote from Pam Morales in a runner magazine. Her exact quote is "Confidence needs evidence". I've adjusted it to the more commonly quoted "Confidence comes from evidence"
          </p>
          <p>
            Where does confidence come from? The simple answer that I've found that feels more solid and tangible is by looking at the evidence. Look back at the 
            times that you have tried to do it or something similar. If you have acomplished it before, or you have a track record of achiving things 
            having the confidence to do something again or for the first time becomes easier. If you haven't the evidence, it will be hard to come up with true confidence.
            Some of it will be arrogant bravado. You can build confidence by breaking down into small chunks and trying to achieve a smaller goal, then put it all back together again.
            Or you can try something one level down, and build up towards the ultimate goal.
          </p>
          <p>
            In summary, you can have confidence based on the things you have done or tried in the past. Put the work in and create
            this evidence and you will have all you need to have true confidence in yourself.
          </p>
