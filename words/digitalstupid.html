          <p>What a hot take! I understand where Mr. Araki is coming from in terms of how I feel when I shoot film photos, but I don't fully agree with him here about the total dismerits of digital images.
            I'd like to think of film and digital as seperate mediums that somehow look similar when presented to an audience. How many people out there can tell what is a photo shot on film and what is
            shot on CCD sensor based on a printed image? To me the fun and emotion of shooting on silver halide is the experience itself. And that is only for myself to experience as it's not something
            that can be shared or properly expressed via the final image.

                … digital cameras are for stupid people. Pictures taken by a digital camera only show the instant
                moment. A digital camera copies the presence of reality. What you see is
                what you get. However, there may be something added to the frame during
                the process of developing or printing when it comes to gelatin silver
                print. There could be sentimental feelings in those photographs. This
                kind of “mysterious secret” goes into the process of using a film
                camera. It is humane, so it is appropriate for photographic expression. I
                do not feel the body temperature of the subject in digital image. There
                is no physicality. A digital camera turns a photographer into a robot,
                with no feeling.
