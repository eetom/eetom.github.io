            Imagine that you were walking in your local alcoholic beverage store and looking through the many types of wine on display.
            You find a red wine that looks pretty interesting, a California Cabernet Sauvignon 2022. You pick up this wine and bring it home excited to have a good wine with dinner.

            At home, you cook up a Ragu Alla Bolognese with some other fresh ingredients you bought at the store. You pour yourself

          <h3>True sake and sake-like drinks</h3>
          <p>
            Back to sake for a moment. Even though this is less like to happen with the red wine from the imagination above, for sake (酒) this is a more common occurence.
            Sake is a Japanese alcoholic beverage made by fermenting rice. It is generally a clear to slightly cloudy semi-sweet non-carbonated drink with about 14 ~ 16 percent of alcohol.
          </p>

          <p>
            A lot of the sake that we buy and drink even while in Japan are not in the pure sense "True sake" but are more sake-like drinks. Drinks that has the basic ingredients of sake
            but also a lot of added additional ingredients and flavors.

          <p>
            Based on this, even in Japan, over 90% of sake being sold are not made purely from rice. How this started was after 2nd World War, Japan and the Japanese agriculture was in ruins.
            Rice was in short supply, and there were restrictions on how much and how it could be used for different applications. Some of the sake breweries during this time started to brew
            "Sanbaizojoshu" (also known as Sanzoshu 三増酒 Translation: 3x increase brew) [<a href="https://en.sake-times.com/learn/sake-101-sanbai-zojo-seishu">read more about Sabaizojoshu here</a>] to make up for the scarcity of 
            rice.
          </p>

          <p>Sanzoshu was made with 30% of the rice usually used for traditional sake, and added additionl distilled alcohols, sugars, and flavors to make up the difference. This was
            was a common practice until the 1960s when rice gradually became more available again. But once some of the breweries got use to offering a cheaper sake-like drink to the public
            they kept some of additional ingredients and process in what is now known as Futsushu 普通酒 (Translation: Ordinary/Common brew) that is largely unregulated of how much distilled alcohols And
            sugars that are added.

          <h3>Sake ranking and taxes</h3>

          <p>
            Originally, sake was put into 3 categories by the Japanese government, Special grade, 1st class, and 2nd class. Seems like a good way to determine what is a good sake.
            However, these had nothing to do with the quality of sake but how much they would be taxed. There were many sakes that were higher quality and taste that was sold under
            the 2nd class label due to breweries paying less tax. This ranking system was abolished by the government in 1992. However, what came afterwards was not much better.
            The new tax system was based on alcoholic percentage. A higher percentage would be taxed at a higer rate. There was no longer and regulation on the ranking of sake quality.
            It was now up to the breweries themselves to set the naming convention. As you guess, this led to no consitentcy or set criteria. A lot of breweries came up with "Special qualty"
            , "Gold label" , "Supreme quality" etc. Making it even harder to differentiate sake in quality and taste.

          <h3>Standing up for Futsushu and Honjozoshu</h3>

                For some sake wankers, Futsushu & Honjozo are the two dirty words of the sake world. Futsushu translates as 'ordinary
                sake' but there are many that are far from ordinary. In Japan these are the sake that hardworking salarymen turn to for
                emotional support after a hard day working for the man.

          <h3>To sum things up</h3>
          <p> I personally like lighter sweeter wines, but this doesn't always match the food. By doing a bit of research it's nice
            to know which red wine would be lighter and sweeter and subtle difference between the white wines. Even the more
            darker full body tasting wines have their place (was amazing with French food, so buttery) and shouldn't be avoided.
            The process to pick out wines is still a very personal choice, and it'll take time and effort to find what suits your
            preferences. Cheers!
