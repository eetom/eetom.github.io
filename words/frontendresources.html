            One of the things that I've been spending my spare time on these days is learn and exploring web front end development.
            It's fascianting to see the design happend on the DOM. Elements flex and wrap in real-time. Micro-interactions and animations
            react and give feedback as you interact with them.
          </p>

          <p>
            As someone who designs a lot of websites and web apps, it's interesting to be also building out those visuals in code rather than
            with vector graphics. I've still got a long way to go and consider myself more of an enthusiastic amature than any level of professional
            front-end code wrangler.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here are some of my favorite resources to learn and be inspired.
          </p>

          <h2>Resources</h2>

          <h3 class="mb0">Smashing Magazine</h3>
          <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a>
          <img src="../img/hosted/smashingmagazine.png" class="blog-img mt4">
          <p>One of the first websites that introduced me to web design and development back in the early 2010s.
            Smashing Magazine has grown as the web has grown past the early days of HTML3. This site is full of
            articles, tutorials, and reviews of the latest front-end technologies.
          </p>

          <h3 class="mb0">Codrops</h3>
          <a href="https://tympanus.net/codrops/">Codrops</a>
          <img src="../img/hosted/codrops.png" class="blog-img mt4">
          <p>Codrops is a website full of really cool demos and examples of front-end interactions that
            constantly amaze me. I find a lot of inspiration and learning from checking out both the demos
            and the showcases of work by other talent folks around the web.
          </p>

          <h3 class="mb0">CSS-Tricks</h3>
          <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS-Tricks</a>
          <img src="../img/hosted/csstricks.png" class="blog-img mt4">
          <p>
            CSS-Tricks is one of my most visited sites. I find the way they break down CSS concepts to be
            the best and easiest to understand. Lots of examples and very in depth coverage of even the newest
            CSS updates. The Flexbox page has been a life saver more times than I can count.
          </p>

          <hr class="mb5 mt4 ml0 small-line" />

          <h3 class="mb0">Codepen.io</h3>
          <a href="https://codepen.io/">Codepen.io</a>
          <img src="../img/hosted/codepen.png" class="blog-img mt4">
          <p>
            Oftentimes, when I'm investigating how to debug things, it's very helpful to have a sandbox to
            see how things work. Codepen allows users to build and run instances of front-end code. I use this
            to adjust and try out code before I incorperate it on my projects.
          </p>

          <h3 class="mb0">Hacker News : Show</h3>
          <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/show">Hacker News : Show</a>
          <img src="../img/hosted/hackernews.png" class="blog-img mt4">
          <p>
            A great source of inspiration, I love checking out the projects that other folks have built. A lot of them
            are way beyond my abilities or even comprehenshion but never fails to at least learn a thing or two.
          </p>

          <hr class="mb5 mt4 ml0 small-line" />
          
          <h3 class="mb0">Chat GPT</h3>
          <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">Chat GPT</a>
          <img src="../img/hosted/chatgpt.png" class="blog-img mt4">
          <p>
            This is my newest partner in crime. Chat GPT is like a very knowledgable resource that can help generate some
            basic code structures. It's primary use for me is to help me understand Javascript structure and semantics, very
            quick and better than looking at old examples on Stackoverflow.
