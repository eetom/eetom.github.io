          <p>Darkrooms are full of chemicals. There are developing agents, fixers, stoppers, bleachs, wetting agents etc etc.. the list goes on. After doing my own developing at home for both
            color and black & white, I've amassed a number of strange bottles and powders with different warning labels on them. As I use up the chemicals reagents, I start to think about how 
            I will dispose of these hazardous chemicals. The municipality has local hazardous wastes sites that I'll have to find time to drop off my used chemicals but I hope this will not be 
            a place that I'll have to visit often.

          <h3>Prepare for development</h3>
          <p>
            When you are ready to start, get the film leader the very tip of the film (before the actual exposed part) out and snip that off. Place the film canister in the film chamber
            on the film side and clip the film with the clip from the reel. If this doesn't make sense, I highly recommend to watch the very <a href="https://youtu.be/Dt7cJy9jXYM">helpful video produced by Cinestill</a> to set up
            and develop in the Lab Box.
          </p>

          <h3>Bath and Agitation</h3>
          <p>
            The rest of the process to get the film delveloped was around 7-8 minutes, main because my "photo lab" was downstairs and bit colder. With temperatures
            around 20 deg C (68 deg F) the recommended development time was about 6 minutes of minimal agitation. I poured in 300ml (aprox 10oz) of the monobath formula into the
            Lab Box and started the timer and turning the agitation dial.

          <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
          <p>Yes, this is exactly what I wanted. An easy way to load and develop a single roll of film at a time. This will work with black and white film, C41 color film, there are 
            modules for 135 film (regular 35mm rolls both 24 and 36 exposures) and also 120 film (Medium format) making this a very flexible system. As long as you aren't looking to develop
            multiple rolls at a time (use a Paterson or a Jobo for that!) it'll be overall very simple. Tons of tutorial online to help you get started. The DF96 monobath is the perfect companion
            to the Lab Box system, a truely one-and-done philisophy that simplifies home film development. 
          </p>
