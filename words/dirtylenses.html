          <h3>The death knells of optical lenses</h3>
          <p>
            I've definitely not taken the best care of some of my photographic gear over time. Over the many years of moving, storage, and use, there has been many a battle scar on 
            some of my equipment. One of the scariest things that can happen to a lens (especially an old lens) is when it starts to grow mold inside. There are other equally scary
            damage that also affect your lens such as haze, scratches, and "dust". But lets take a step back and break down a few terms and concepts.</p>

          <table class="mt4">
            <tr>
              <th>Problem</th>
              <th>Cause</th>
              <th>Notes</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Mold/Fungus</td>
              <td>Microscopic organisms in the air settle on dark and humid lens elements. They grow as they break down the lens coatings. </td>
              <td>I'm not sure if there are ways to get rid of mold once it has taken root on your lens beyond a full dissasembly and chemical cleaning.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Haze/Oil</td>
              <td>Haze or oil appear from 2 places in your lens. The first is the oil from the mechanical aperture blades run on to your lens elements. The second is the optical glue
                or lubricants used in lens assembly break down and coat your lens.
              </td>
              <td>2 primary effects of haze, localized haze which is more spotty and overall haze with is a semi-opaque layer over an area of the lens.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Scratches</td>
              <td>Preety self-explanatory, when sharp or edgy things rub against the lens elements, can lead to scratching and even taking a chunk out of the glass. 
              </td>
              <td>Somebody explain to me how internal scratching happens? Dust particles? It's not unheard of, but more rare.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Dust/particles</td>
              <td>This is espeically common with zoom lenses where the movement of the lens barrel can create vacuums that suck in dust and particles.
              </td>
              <td>One more rare case for particles is paint or other coatings internal to the lens breaking down inside the lens.</td>
            </tr>
          </table>

          <h3>.. or is it?</h3>

          <p>That was a lot of scary stuff. All the things that make up the nightmares of photographers and camera collectors everywhere. I do own a few lenses that have mold and a few
            of my older lenses even have scratches. But how much of that really affects the usage of these lenses? The answer is not very much effect. The people over at <a href="kamerastore.com/en-us">
            The Kamera Store</a> have been working on reparing, cleaning, and selling camera gear for a while, and they know a thing or two about damaged lenses. I've recently read an article
            they published about <a href="https://kamerastore.com/en-us/blogs/posts/does-a-dirty-lens-affect-image-quality-fungus-scratches-haze-more">Does a Dirty Lens Affect Image Quality? Fungus, Scratches, Haze & More!</a>
            (from January 24, 2022) as a not super-scientific, but pretty fun exploration of the quality of photos you get from various level of dirty damanaged lenses.

          <h3>Results you can see</h3>

          <p>
            This is some scary stuff, you could do everything correctly, assemble, load, timing, changing chemicals. And then when you go to open the tank and see your
            photos for the first time to rinse. You get what every home film developer dreads. The entire roll is blank.
          </p>

          <h3>In conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            The moral of the story is, to always take your time preparing your film for development. Whether it is assembling your
            development tank, loading the film, making the chemicals do what you want, and also handling the film itself once you
            finally do everything correctly. The end results should be photos that are well developed even if they are not well
            composed. The development and scanning process is very complicated, but I'd like to think that it's half the fun
            of taking photos with film.
