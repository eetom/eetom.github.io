          <p>Hello, and happy 2025! This will be my first writing in a while. The topic for this writing 
            will be about IDA or Independent Design Action.
          </p>
          <hr class="mb5 mt4 ml0 small-line" />

          <h3>What is it?</h3>
          <p>Sometimes you might feel stuck on something at work. Whether you are waiting for some team member to provide feedback, review, or even requirements. What do you do during that time?
            how do you make the best of it. There are many traps to fall into of waiting, disctraction, or even being too demanding of the people you need to talk to. Make sure that you can find ways
            to keep working and stay focused with independent design actions.
          </p>
          <p>Independent design action (IDA) refers to design work that can be proactively completed without requiring immediate input, approval, or dependencies from other teams or stakeholders. These are tasks that designers can autonomously drive forward to maintain momentum on projects.</p>

          <h3>Key Characteristics of IDA</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Self-contained work that doesn't require cross-team decisions</li>
            <li>Can be completed using existing information and requirements</li>
            <li>Produces useful documentation or progress even if other team workstreams are blocked</li>
            <li>Reduces future bottlenecks by preparing ahead and keeping the projects moving</li>
          </ol>

              <p class="f5 f4-m f3-l lh-copy measure mt0">
                Make your own decisions and take action!

          <h3>How to IDA - Running in the dark:</h3>

          <h4>Information Completeness - Enough to start</h4>
          <p>Basically you don't need to have perfect information as long as you get started and acknowledge that
            you don't have all the details. This gives people a chance later to see how you got to where you are.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>User flows and/or Customer journeys to better understand and create consensus with the team</li>
            <li>If you have asumptions about the basic requirements or constraints document what you do know and you don't know</li>
            <li>Look for existing patterns or similar features exist as reference</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>What else can be researched or improved on the project itself?</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Review current projects for gaps or inconsistencies</li>
            <li>Identify repeated patterns that need systematizing</li>
            <li>Look for features that need dark mode/responsive design</li>
            <li>Check for accessibility compliance</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Create Work Chunks - don't get stuck on a step!</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Break larger problems into smaller, independent pieces</li>
            <li>Identify which pieces can move forward with current information</li>
            <li>Separate "must have input" vs "can refine later" decisions</li>
            <li>Document assumptions and constraints clearly</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="pa4">
            <blockquote class="ml0 mt0 pl4 black-90 bl bw2  ">
              <p class="f5 f4-m f3-l lh-copy measure mt0">
                Just focus on one thing. One plan. Focus on one step of one plan that you can do today!
              </p>
            </blockquote>
          </div>

          <h4>Prioritization Framework - Questions to ask yourself:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>"Can I complete this piece without waiting for others?"</li>
            <li>"Will this work be valuable even if requirements change?"</li>
            <li>"Does this reduce future design debt?"</li>
            <li>"What information will I need later when I can get help"</li>
            <li>"Can this be validated independently?"</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Documentation Process - Always have a paper trail</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Track assumptions made</li>
            <li>Note areas needing future validation</li>
            <li>Document decisions and rationale</li>
            <li>Keep a list of questions for later clarification</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>IDA Benefits - It's a win for everyone!</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Maintains project momentum during blockers</li>
            <li>Reduces dependency bottlenecks</li>
            <li>Allows for deeper exploration and understanding of solutions</li>
            <li>Creates proactive rather than reactive design culture for your team</li>
            <li>Ambiguity is part of the job sometimes, you have to learn and get better at dealing with it. Everyone does.</li>
          </ol>

            <p>Key takeaways</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Stay focused, it's tempting to work on other tasks</li>
              <li>Work with what you got, document what you do and don't know</li>
              <li>Break down the specific parts that you are stuck on, work on the parts you can.</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
