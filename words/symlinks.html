          <p><b>Symbolic links</b> otherwise known as <b>Symlinks</b>, are pointers that act or replicate the presence of 
            the file it is pointing to. For example you want to have a file show up in a second location without actually 
            having to copy and paste the desired file into that secondary location you could use a symlink.
          </p>

          <p>You can use symlinks not only with indvidual files, but also with entire directories (and even point at another
            symlinks). A good use for symlinks is for configuration files that need to be set the same way in many different
            folders/directories. You would just set up a symlink to point at the configuration file from the original directory 
            in the secondary directory.
          </p>

          <p>There are 2 types of symlinks, a "hard" symlink and a "soft" symlink. A soft symlink is similar to a shortcut, 
            it would be in the folder and when you want to access it, you would be redirected to the actual location of the file.
          A hard symlink would be more than just a redirect, it would work as if the file was in secondary directory.
          </p>

          <h3> Here's how you could set up symlinks in Windows</h3>
          
          <p>In Windows you can access the built in tools to create symlinks within Powershell</p>
          <p class="code">C:/Users/user>mklink</p>
          <br />

          <p>This will prompt you to choose from 3 options: </p>
          <p class="code">MKLINK [[/D] | [/H] | [/J]] Link Target</p>
          <p>/D makes a Directory link (soft, can be file or directory)</p>
          <p>/J makes a Junction link (hard, but directory only, not direct on file)</p>
          <p>/H makes a Hard link (can only be a local file not directory) does not take up real drive space</p>
          <br />

          <p>You could enter in something like this..</p>
          <p class="code">mklink /D "C:\PS\Downloads" "C:\Users\user\Downloads"</p>
          <p>This would create a Directory link, that would exist in the directory PS\Downloads, and would point at user\Downloads</p>
          <br />

          <p class="blog-callout"><b>NOTE:</b> In order to create symlinks in Windows you must have admin access. Otherwise you will get an error that tells you "ou do not have sufficient privilege to perform this operation"</p>
