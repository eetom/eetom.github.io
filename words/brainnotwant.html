            I think there are a lot of content creators that have very similar messages around motivation and drive. There's a lot of jadedness whenever I see their
            video thumbnails or video titles, "5 steps to become more productive" or things like "I discovered the hack to build habits". So this was also the case
            when I saw a video on Youtube called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLKIDHssTAA&t=216">"Become more disciplined in literally 5 minutes"</a> by Ruff.
            I was bored at the time, so I clicked the video in the hopes of being entertained for a few minutes. <br><br>
            I'm not going to say this video 'changed my life' or anything that drastic, but I did enjoy one specific quote from the video. "What does my brain not want to do?"
            This quote was impactful to me because it's reframing the question, rather than to focus on what habit I was trying to build or what 'hacks' I was trying to
            motivate myself with, this was just flipping the question around to understand where the resistance was coming from. My brain didn't want to be uncomfortable,
            it didn't want to be spending energy, or do something that was not a guarenteed outcome. But by understanding this, I feel just a tiny bit less resistance
            once I accepted my brain's position.

            The video also covers the concept of 'comfort zone', and this is a big part of my life I want to change. I live in a pretty confortable zone, nothing too dangerous or scary in my 
            day-to-day life. Getting use to being uncomfortable is different for everyone, but doing something is better than doing nothing about it. I feel that some of my friends have built up stronger
            muscles of discomfort and are more resiliant in uncomfortable situations. But it was a good reminder for myself to go at my own pace, as long as I'm making progress.

                We should get to the point where we're so consistently outside our comfort zone that we don't even describe as taking a step outside of our 
                comfort zone anymore. We simply live outside of our comfort zone.
