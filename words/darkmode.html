          <h2>Hello darkness, my old friend...</h2>
          <p class="caption">For best reading experince, try this in dark mode!!!</p>
          <p>Seriously though, there are too many times at night or in a low lit environment where I wanted to open up a webpage on my phone and the website
            is glaringly bright burn-through-your-retinas bright. Thank goodness for the wave of darkmode websites and mobile OS level settings that were all the
            rage the last few years. I think it's very cool to use darkmode as a way for users to have some customized control over their web experience, both
            in the browser and at the app/platform level.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are a lot of 3rd party browser extensions that one could install to force that experience on to web pages that don't have dark mode enabled.
            This is a nice option, but requires the user to install an extention for each of the browser they experience the web through. There really isn't much
            choice sometimes. 
          </p>

          <hr class="mb5 mt4 ml0 small-line" />
          <h3>Part 1: Implementation, the how?</h3>
          <p>
            What I've decided to do was to add dark mode to this website, but without the user having to toggle on/off their desired experience each time
            they land here. (Not saying that I have that many repeat readers, so mostly for my own benefit.) The idea was to use <code>windows.localStorage</code> to save
            the preference for beyond the session. (That would be using <code>sessionStorage</code> which would wipe clean once they close the tab/window.)
          </p>

          <p>
            First things first, we'll create a button to toggle between the modes.
            I've added into my header a simple button that will toggle between a sun icon and a moon icon to indicate the two modes.
          </p>

          <p class="code">
              &lt;input type="checkbox" class="checkbox" id="checkbox"&gt; <br />
              &lt;label for="checkbox" class="checkbox-label"&gt; <br />
                &lt;i class="material-icons moon" style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;dark_mode&lt;/i&gt; <br />
                &lt;i class="material-icons sun" style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;light_mode&lt;/i&gt; <br />
                &lt;span class="ball"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; <br />
              &lt;/label> <br />
          </p>
          <p>This creates a nice little toggle like this...</p>
          <p class="code">
              <input type="checkbox" class="checkbox" id="checkbox">
              <label for="checkbox" class="checkbox-label">
                <i class="material-icons moon" style="font-size: 16px;">dark_mode</i>
                <i class="material-icons sun" style="font-size: 16px;">light_mode</i>
                <span class="ball"></span>
              </label>
          </p>

          <p>Then we have to have a trigger for when the checkbox element is click we can move the ball to give that toggle animation effect</p>

          <p class="code">
            .checkbox-label { <br />
            background-color: #f39c12; <br />
            width: 40px; <br />
            height: 16px; <br />
            border-radius: 50px; <br />
            position: relative; <br />
            padding: 5px; <br />
            cursor: pointer; <br />
            display: flex; <br />
            justify-content: space-between; <br />
            align-items: center; <br />
            }
            <br />
            .moon {<br />
            color: #FFE992; /* add some color for the moon. */<br />
            } <br />
            <br />
            .sun { <br />
            color: #fff; /* add some color for the sun. */<br />
            } <br />
            <br />
            .checkbox-label .ball { <br />
            background-color: #fff; <br />
            width: 22px; <br />
            height: 22px; <br />
            position: absolute; <br />
            left: 2px; <br />
            top: 2px; <br />
            border-radius: 50%; <br />
            transition: transform 0.2s linear; <br />
            } <br />
            <br />
            /* here's the magic when checkbox is checked, this will move/transform the ball */
            .checkbox:checked+.checkbox-label .ball { <br />
            transform: translateX(24px);<br />
            }<br />
          </p>

          <p>Once we have that set up the next thing will be to set up some Javascript to allow us to implement dark mode or switch back to light mode.</p>
          <p>The idea here is that when the toggle is activated ("clicked on") it will prompt the code to add an extra CSS class ("dark") to the <code>Body</code> element.
          We'll use this CSS class to then override the normal CSS "light mode" styling with a set of custom "dark mode" colors and styles.</p>

          <p>The other thing we will want to implment is was concept we had earlier for have <code>windows.localStorage</code> to save values beyond the individual page.</p>

          <p class="code">
            &lt;script&gt; <br />
              const toggleBtn = document.getElementById("checkbox"); <br />
              let darkMode = localStorage.getItem("dark-mode"); <br />
              <br />
              const enableDarkMode = () => { <br />
                document.body.classList.add("dark"); <br />
                localStorage.setItem("dark-mode", "dark"); <br /> 
              };<br />
              <br />
              const disableDarkMode = () => {<br />
                document.body.classList.remove("dark");<br />
                localStorage.setItem("dark-mode", "light");<br />
              };<br />
              <br />
              if (darkMode === "dark") {<br />
                enableDarkMode(); // set state of darkMode on page load<br />
              } else {<br />
                disableDarkMode(); // start with light mode<br />
              }<br />
              <br />
              toggleBtn.addEventListener("click", (e) => {<br />
                darkMode = localStorage.getItem("dark-mode"); // update darkMode when clicked<br />
                if (darkMode === "light") {<br />
                  enableDarkMode();<br />
                } else {<br />
                  disableDarkMode();<br />
                }<br />
              });<br />
            &lt;/script&gt;<br />
          </p>

          <p>To be honest, I'm still having some issues with this, maybe i'll figure it out later. The on load state of the toggle sometimes is reversed. It'll be in light mode but the icon is the moon.
            and then clicking on it will turn to dark mode, but the icon will be the sun. I'll leave it for Future-Eric™ to solve that problem.
          </p>

          <img class="blog-img" src="../img/hosted/toggleerror.png">
          <p class="caption">You can see here that the "sun" is dark...and when you click on it, the moon is bright.</p>

          <div class="blog-callout">
            <h3>Future-Eric™ here!</h3>
            <p>
              I've fixed the problem. The issue was that when the <code>localStorage</code> was set to <code>dark</code> and the page was refreshed, the default
              position for the label is "light mode". So what I've added was when the page loads and it's checking if <code>localStorage</code> is <code>dark</code> it'll also check the
              <code>#checkbox</code> automatically to set it to the correct toggle position. 
            </p>
            <p><code>document.getElementById("checkbox").checked = true;</code></p>
            <p>and</p>
            <p><code>document.getElementById("checkbox").checked = false;</code></p>
            <p>if it's light mode just to make sure the checkbox is unchecked and toggle in the light mode position.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Part 2: Designing a dark mode experience</h3>
          <p>
            So now we have a cool toggle button, we still need to decide what dark mode how will actually look and feel. I'm more use to designing for white backgrounds 
            and the required amount of contrast from the fonts and colors. But how different will dark mode alterantive be?
          </p>

          <img class="blog-img" src="../img/hosted/google_material_design_dark.png">
          <p class="caption"><a href="https://m2.material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html">Material Design dark theme</a>. Google has a lot of documentation they set up for working with dark themes in Android.</p>

          <p>
            For example, the background color that is recommended is <code>dark grey #121212</code>. This is because dark grey is less contrasty than black and is better for less eye strain.
            White/light color text on dark grey is a bit more readable.
          </p>

          <img class="blog-img" src="../img/hosted/materialdark.png">
          <p class="caption"><a href="https://m2.material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html">Material Design dark theme</a>. Google
            suggestion on how to create and design dark mode color themes.</p>

          <p>
            Another point from Material design, is the use of the theme primary color. In light mode / light backgrounds, there is a case to use the primary color more frequently.
            But in the world of dark mode, the suggestion is to use color more sparingly, a bit more of a desaturated theme rather than just inverted light theme.
          </p>

          <p>What I ended up with for my color themes are ..</p>

          <hr class="mb5 mt4 ml0 small-line" />
          
          <h3>Part 3: Other considerations for working with dark mode</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Operating system level dark mode</li>
            <p>
              Something you can add to your code is to align with system level dark/light mode settings. To do this we'll be working with the <code>prefers-color-scheme</code> CSS custom property.
              You can have it at either <code>no preference</code>, <code>light</code>, or <code>dark</code>. The place to apply this is in your CSS media queries (this is activated by the state of your
              viewport/screen). In this case, we'll be looking for any system level light/dark mode settings.
            </p>

            <p class="code">
              /* For example, if you have this code.. */
              <br />
              @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {<br />
              body {<br />
              color: #eee;<br />
              background: #121212;<br />
              }<br />
              <br />
              a {<br />
              color: #809fff;<br />
              }<br />
              }<br />

              /* When the system is set to dark mode, the browser settings will also be set to dark mode. */
            </p>
            
            <li>Other ways to store user preferences</li>
            <p>
              The two main ways that I've researched for storing user preferences for websites are to either use
              <code>localStorage</code> or cookies (with a server side language).
              I've opted to use the <code>localStorage</code> as I didn't want to get into optimizing cookies and working with PHP.
            </p>

            <p>I'm not very familiar with PHP and other server side languages, but for those who want to find out more check out this 
              <a href="https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-dark-mode-on-the-web/#storing-preferences">section</a> of the CSS-tricks: a complete
            guide to dark mode on the web.</p>
            
            <li>Darkend dark images</li>
            <p>
              Something to consider when switching over to dark mode is to think about how images look in dark mode. We have made
              changes to the text and background colors, but images can be still very bright and harsh on the eyes in a dark
              envrionment.
              Something that can be suggested it to lower the brightness of the image, but slight up the contrast to retain the
              details. From the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-dark-mode-on-the-web/">CSS-tricks: a complete
                guide to dark mode on the web</a>,
              I've used their suggestion to add an css <code>filter: brightness (.8) contrast (1.2)</code> to my images to adjust
              for a dark viewing environment.
            </p>
            
            <p class="code">
              body.dark img { <br />
              filter: brightness(.8) contrast(1.2);<br />
              }<br />
            </p>

            <p class="caption">Adjusting the brightness and contrast to keep the image from being too bright for viewing in dark mode</p>

            
            <li>Dark mode shadows</li>
            <p>
              Something that is suggested is to also consider the shadows used in light mode and dark mode. My website doesn't
              really use shadows so this probably won't be something I'll add, but the idea
              is that it doesn't look good inverted. Instead of using shadows, try changing the background color of the components
              so that there is a dept effect, where lighter elements "float" to the top
              and darker elements are "lower".
            </p>

            <img class="blog-img" src="../img/hosted/dropshadow.png">
            <p class="caption">Light shadow looks strange on dark backgrounds. We're more use to seeing shadows as additional darkness not light.</p>


            <li>Browser User Agent theme</li>
            <p>When you are working with default browser ui, such as buttons, scroll bars and checkboxes, you can also adjust this over to match the mode your page is in.
              Using the <code>color-scheme</code> css attribute, you can set the system colors to <code>dark</code>, <code>light</code>, <code>only dark</code> and <code>only light</code>.
              Note that <code>only dark</code> and <code>only light</code> are not supported across many browsers (I think only iOS Safari and desktop Safari support it currently.) Check out
              <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/c/color-scheme/">css-tricks: CSS Almanac → Properties → C → color-scheme</a> for more about color scheme.
            </p>
            <p class="code">
              color-scheme: normal; <br />
              color-scheme: light;<br />
              color-scheme: dark;<br />
              color-scheme: light dark;<br />
              color-scheme: dark light;<br />
              color-scheme: only light;<br />
              color-scheme: only dark;<br />
            </p>
          </ul>

          <h3>Conclusion: Dark learnings</h3>

          <p>
            Adding in a dark theme mode, even if its to just match the system prefereces is not hard, but it can have very visible impact on user experience on the website.
            I've had many times where I open my web page to show friends only to be blasted by light in a darker environment. (This may be due to how dark and gloomy it is here
            in the pacific northwest in the winter time.) But getting to back to the topic at hand, dark mode really adds another layer of thinking to how you might approach
            varible experiences for web. Regardless of the reason, there are considerations for colors, fonts, layouts, and even how images sit on different background colors.
            This was a good exercies for me to really think about even how I appraoch these factors in light mode. I hope you also consider the learnings and maybe add a 
            dark mode option for your website.
          </p>
