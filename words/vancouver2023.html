        <div class="fl-ns w-50-m w-60-l pr3-m pr5-l">
          <p>I grew up in Vancouver, and for most of my life I’ve lived, worked, and ate in the greater Vancouver area. But in the
          last 8 years or so, I’ve been mostly living in the US. In that short couple of years, a large number of restaurants came
          and went, businesses opened and went out of business, new buildings were built, the general landscape of the city ever
          changing. I often get asked where to go, what to do, and more importantly what to eat. Some things in the city never
          change, but even I have to double check if a previous favorite sushi restaurant was still open for business or if a new
          coffee shop has replaced old favorites as the best in town.</p>

          <p class="mb5"></p>

          <h2>List 1: Classical Vancouver spots in detail</h2>
          
          <h3>Granville island</h3>
          <p>
            <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/MvXERgqbDzDXcBcw7">Google link</a><br>
            This is a fun spot for locals and tourists alike, full of food, fresh markets, craft artisan studios, even a few
            theaters. Plan at least a half day with plenty of things to see and do. Easily one of the top places I recommend.
          </p>

          <hr class="mb5 mt4 ml0 small-line" />

          <h3>Vancouver Seawall walk</h3>
          <p>
            This is a long walk along the embankments of the pacific ocean along the entire stretch of downtown Vancouver, crossing
            many local parks and beaches. Plenty of rest spots for food and drink along the way. Great views of English Bay and
            Vancouver Harbour. Start wherever you want, from the west English Bay Beach is a typical location (and where the usually
            host the firework festival each year) and from the east start from Canada Place convention center all along the Coal
            Harbour neighborhood. The longest part of the walk is around the entirety of Stanley Park (10km or 6mi)
          </p>

          <h3>North Vancouver Lonsdale Quay</h3>
          <p>
            <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/CANxPZS7ow8qenzV9">Google link</a><br>
            It’s not just the destination its also the journey! Something of a fun distraction, if you are in the downtown area near
            Waterfront Station, take the Seabus ferry from downtown Vancouver across the harbour to North Vancouver and the Lonsdale
            Quay (12 minutes one way), the quay is a quaint market for a quick bite. If you have some extra time before heading back
            to downtown Vancouver, check out the nearby parks (Waterfront park/Ambleside park) to see a different view of the
            Vancouver skyline from across the water.
          </p>

          <hr class="mb5 mt4 ml0 small-line" />

          <h3>Steveston Fisherman’s Wharf Richmond</h3>
          <p>
            <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/m7dJvKdTjwd7UmLy8">Google link</a><br>
            Steveston was the first neighborhood I lived in when we first moved to Canada. In particular the downtown
            area/fisherman’s wharf is a historical maritime cannery and fishing industry center at the mouth of the Fraser river and
            the Pacific ocean. Today it’s a bit more touristy and fun historical area with lots of seafood and local shops. Walk
            towards Garry Point park after a meal and enjoy the views of the ocean. (This is a bit out of the way, roughly a 44min
            drive distance from downtown Vancouver)
          </p>

          <hr class="mb5 mt4 ml0 small-line" />

          <h3>Capilano Suspension Bridge Park</h3>
          <p>
            <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/xZmNUaAoQr7egk428">Google link</a><br>
            Another fun albeit touristy place to check out if you have the chance. A bit far from the center of Vancouver towards
            the north, but there is a free shuttle bus to the park. Be prepared to pay (Roughly $50 Canadian buckeroos per person)
            to access the park, but well worth it if only just to see the the titular suspension bridge (450 feet/137 meters long,
            and 230 feet/70 meters above the Capilano river). There are many other things to see and do in the park, ranging from
            miles of trails though gardens and maintained forests, treetop adventures, local historical exhibits.
          </p>

          <h3>Gastown</h3>
          <p>
            <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/4DHXTCddzqJZq9kN8">Google link</a><br>
            If you want some nightlife or just some unique and interesting foods and beverages, here’s where I spent many a nights
            and next day mornings. From dinner options, clubs, speakeasy bars, and fancy pants coffee shops to boutique fashion
            brands and tourists targeting gift shops, this area of town has a bit of that big European city feeling right down to
            the cobble stone streets and lampposts. The restaurants and shops may change, but Gastown remains ever the rough and
            moody part of the city. Note: As you walk eastwards towards Main St. it’ll get rougher and grimier, be warned if this is
            your first taste of the downtown eastside. I usually turn back around by the time I hit Columbia St.
          </p>

          <hr class="mb5 mt4 ml0 small-line" />

          <h3>Vancouver Art Gallery</h3>
          <p>
            <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/qgkA9sABDLr5Y79N9">Google link</a><br>
            Huge gallery, 3 floors, multiple wings. Usually pretty cool stuff here, in the middle of downtown area.
          </p>

          <hr class="mb5 mt4 ml0 small-line" />

          <h3>Telus World of Science</h3>
          <p>
            <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/185z29Ljoe5GcoNu7">Google link</a><br>
            Another multi hour activity, very fun interactive science stuff. One of my favorite places as a kid. Fun for the whole
            family. I still just call it the old name “Science World”
          </p>

          <p>I'll probably update this again as things change, but should be some pretty solid recommendations. Again, this is based on my own personal preferences, 
            not what some may consider the best of the best.</p>
